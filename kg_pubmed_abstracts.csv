DOI: 10.3233/JAD-215303  PMID: 35723096 |Characterization of Early Alzheimer's Disease-Like Pathological Alterations in Non-Human Primates with Aging: A Pilot Study.|BACKGROUND: Sporadic or late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with aging the most known risk factor. Non-human primates (NHPs) may serve as an excellent model to study LOAD because of their close similarity to humans in many aspects including neuroanatomy and neurodevelopment. Recent studies reveal AD-like pathology in old NHPs. OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we took advantage of brain samples from 6 Cynomolgus macaques that were divided into two groups: middle aged (average age 14.81 years) and older (average age 19.33 years). We investigated whether AD-like brain pathologies are present in the NHPs. METHODS: We used immunohistochemical method to examine brain Aβ pathology and neuron density. We applied biochemical assays to measure tau phosphorylation and  multiple signaling pathways indicated in AD. We performed electron microscopy experiments to study alterations of postsynaptic density and mitochondrial morphology in the brain of NHPs. RESULTS: We found multiple AD-like pathological alteration in the prefrontal cortex (but not in the hippocampus) of the older NHPs including tau hyperphosphorylation, increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),  decreased expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), impairments in mitochondrial morphology, and postsynaptic densities formation. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide insights into the factors contributing to  the development of LOAD, particularly during the early stage transitioning from middle to old age. Future endeavors are warranted to elucidate mechanisms underlying the regional (and perhaps cellular) vulnerability with aging and the functional correlation of such pathological changes in NHPs.

We used the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) on selected targets and assayed synapse function and plasticity by electrophysiology. We focused our screen on genetic factors known to be conserved from human neurological or muscle functions (300 Drosophila lines screened). From our screen, knockdown of a Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunit  gene (ND-20L) lowered levels of NMJ neurotransmission. Due to the severity of the phenotype, we studied MCI function further. Knockdown of core MCI subunits concurrently in neurons and muscle led to impaired neurotransmission. We localized this neurotransmission function to the muscle. Pharmacology targeting MCI phenocopied the impaired neurotransmission phenotype. Finally, MCI subunit knockdowns or pharmacological inhibition led to profound cytological defects, including reduced NMJ growth and altered NMJ morphology. Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Five multi-protein complexes achieve this task, and MCI is the largest. Impaired Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in humans are associated with  disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Leigh syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Together, our data present an analysis of Complex I in the context of synapse function and plasticity. We speculate that in the context of human MCI dysfunction, similar neuronal and synaptic defects could contribute to pathogenesis.

We used a rat GMH model and performed RNA sequencing to investigate the signaling pathways  and biological processes following hemorrhage. GMH induced brain injury characterized by early hematoma and subsequent tissue loss. At 6 hours after GMH, gene expression indicated an increase in mitochondrial activity such as ATP metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation along with upregulation of cytoprotective pathways and heme metabolism. At 24 hours after GMH, the expression pattern suggested an increase in cell cycle progression and downregulation of neurodevelopmental-related pathways. At 72 hours after GMH, there was an increase in genes related to inflammation and an upregulation of ferroptosis. Hemoglobin components and genes related to heme metabolism and ferroptosis such as Hmox1, Alox15, and Alas2 were among the most upregulated genes. We observed dysregulation of processes involved in development, mitochondrial function, cholesterol biosynthesis, and inflammation, all of which  contribute to neurodevelopmental deterioration following GMH. This study is the first temporal transcriptome profile providing a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain injury following GMH, and it provides useful guidance in the search for therapeutic interventions.

DCX is a microtubule-associated protein which plays a key role during neurodevelopment in neuronal migration and differentiation. Dcx knockout (KO) mice show disorganized hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The CA2/CA3 pyramidal cell  layer is present as two abnormal layers and disorganized CA3 KO pyramidal neurons are also more excitable than wild-type (WT) cells. To further identify abnormalities, we characterized Dcx KO hippocampal neurons at subcellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. Severe defects were observed in mitochondria, affecting number and distribution. Also, the Golgi apparatus was visibly abnormal, increased in volume and abnormally organized. Transcriptome analyses from laser microdissected hippocampal tissue at postnatal day 60 (P60) highlighted organelle abnormalities. Ultrastructural studies of CA3 cells performed in P60 (young adult) and > 9 months (mature) tissue showed that organelle defects are persistent throughout life. Locomotor activity and fear memory of young and mature adults were also abnormal: Dcx KO mice consistently performed less well than WT littermates, with defects becoming more severe with age. Thus, we show that disruption of a neurodevelopmentally-regulated gene can lead to permanent organelle anomalies contributing to abnormal adult behavior.

Approximately two-thirds of the patients suffering from LSD exhibit neurological deficits and impose an escalating challenge to the medical and scientific field. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)  technology has aided researchers in efficiently generating functional neuronal and non-neuronal cells through directed differentiation protocols, as well as in  decoding the cellular, subcellular, and molecular defects associated with LSDs using two-dimensional cultures and cerebral organoid models. This review highlights the information assembled from patient-derived iPSCs on neurodevelopmental and neuropathological defects identified in LSDs. Multiple studies have identified neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation defects, substrate accumulation, axon growth and myelination defects, impaired calcium homeostasis, and altered electrophysiological properties, using patient-derived iPSCs. In addition, these studies have also uncovered defective lysosomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, autophagy and vesicle trafficking and signaling pathways, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation,  blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neurodegeneration, gliosis, and altered transcriptomes in LSDs. The review also discusses the therapeutic applications such as drug discovery, repurposing of drugs, synergistic effects of drugs, targeted molecular therapies, gene therapy, and transplantation applications of mutation-corrected lines identified using patient-derived iPSCs for different LSDs.

Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (bNIRS) provides the opportunity to explore the relationship between cerebral energy metabolism and blood oxygenation/haemodynamics through the measurement of changes in the oxidation state of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome-c-oxidase (ΔoxCCO) alongside haemodynamic changes. We used a bNIRS system to measure ΔoxCCO and haemodynamics during functional activation in a group of 42 typically developing infants aged between 4 and 7 months. bNIRS measurements were made over the right hemisphere over temporal, parietal and central cortical regions, in response to social and non-social visual and auditory stimuli. Both ΔoxCCO and Δ[HbO2] displayed larger activation for the social condition in comparison to the non-social condition. Integration of haemodynamic and metabolic signals revealed  networks of stimulus-selective cortical regions that were not apparent from analysis of the individual bNIRS signals. These results provide the first spatially resolved measures of cerebral metabolic activity alongside haemodynamics during functional activation in infants. Measuring synchronised changes in metabolism and haemodynamics have the potential for uncovering the development of cortical specialisation in early infancy.

Mutations in COQ8A in humans result in CoQ10 deficiency, the clinical features of which include early-onset cerebellar ataxia, seizures and intellectual disability. The rapid advancement of massively parallel sequencing has resulted in the identification of more than 40 new mutations in COQ8A and functional studies are required to confirm causality and to further research into determining the specific mechanisms through which the mutations result in loss of function. To that end, a Drosophila model of Coq8 deficiency was developed and characterized to determine its appropriateness as a model system to further explore the role of Coq8 in the brain, and for functional characterisation of Coq8 mutations. Pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of Coq8 was largely lethal, with female escapers displaying severe locomotor deficits. Knockdown of Coq8 in the eye resulted in degeneration of photoreceptors, progressive necrosis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Reintroduction of wild-type Coq8 restored normal function, however expression of human wild-type COQ8A exacerbated the eye phenotype, suggesting it was acting as a dominant-negative. This model is therefore informative for investigating the function of Drosophila Coq8, however  human COQ8A mutations cannot be assessed as hCOQ8A does not rescue Coq8 deficiency.

The deficiency in AGC1/Aralar leads to the human rare disease named "early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 39" (EIEE 39, OMIM # 612949) characterized by epilepsy, hypotonia, arrested psychomotor neurodevelopment, hypo myelination and a drastic drop in brain aspartate (Asp) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Current evidence suggest that neurons are the main brain cell type expressing Aralar. However, paradoxically, glial functions such as myelin and Glutamine (Gln) synthesis are markedly impaired in AGC1 deficiency. Herein, we discuss the role of the AGC1/Aralar-MAS pathway in neuronal functions such as Asp and NAA synthesis, lactate use, respiration on glucose, glutamate (Glu) oxidation and other neurometabolic aspects. The possible mechanism triggering the pathophysiological findings in AGC1 deficiency, such as epilepsy and postnatal hypomyelination observed in humans and mice, are also included. Many of these mechanisms arise from findings  in the aralar-KO mice model that extensively recapitulate the human disease including the astroglial failure to synthesize Gln and the dopamine (DA) mishandling in the nigrostriatal system. Epilepsy and DA mishandling are a direct consequence of the metabolic defect in neurons due to AGC1/Aralar deficiency. However, the deficits in myelin and Gln synthesis may be a consequence of neuronal affectation or a direct effect of AGC1/Aralar deficiency in glial cells. Further research is needed to clarify this question and delineate the transcellular metabolic fluxes that control brain functions. Finally, we discuss  therapeutic approaches successfully used in AGC1-deficient patients and mice.

Here, we examined whether cellular metabolism regulates microglial function during neurodevelopment. Microglial mitochondria bioenergetics correlated with and were  functionally coupled to phagocytic activity in the developing brain. Transcriptional profiling of microglia with diverse metabolic profiles revealed an activation signature wherein the interleukin (IL)-33 signaling axis is associated with phagocytic activity. Genetic perturbation of IL-33 or its receptor ST2 led to microglial dystrophy, impaired synaptic function, and behavioral abnormalities. Conditional deletion of Il33 from astrocytes or Il1rl1, encoding ST2, in microglia increased susceptibility to seizures. Mechanistically, IL-33 promoted mitochondrial activity and phagocytosis in an AKT-dependent manner. Mitochondrial metabolism and AKT activity were temporally regulated in vivo. Thus, a microglia-astrocyte circuit mediated by the IL-33-ST2-AKT signaling axis supports microglial metabolic adaptation and phagocytic function during early development, with implications for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

In addition, alterations in dopamine signaling may be also involved in the pathophysiology of  psychiatric disorders. Neurodevelopment is modulated in multiple steps by reactive oxygen species (ROS), byproducts of oxidative metabolism that are signaling factors involved in proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Hexokinase (HK), when associated with the mitochondria (mt-HK), is a potent modulator of the generation of mitochondrial ROS in the brain. In the present study, we investigated whether dopamine could affect both the activity and redox  function of mt-HK in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that dopamine signaling via D1R decreases mt-HK activity and impairs ROS modulation, which is followed by an expressive release of H2O2 and impairment in calcium handling by the mitochondria. Nevertheless, mitochondrial respiration is not affected, suggesting specificity for dopamine on mt-HK function. In neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of schizophrenia patients, mt-HK is unable to decrease mitochondrial ROS, in contrast with NSCs derived from healthy individuals. Our data point to mitochondrial hexokinase as a novel target of dopaminergic signaling, as well as a redox modulator in human neural progenitor cells, which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.

The disease is characterized by an X-linked mutation of the Fmr1 gene, which causes silencing of the gene coding for fragile X mental retardation  protein (FMRP), a translational regulator integral for neurodevelopment. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recently associated with FXS, with reports of  increases in oxidative stress markers, reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation being present in the brain tissue. Astrocytes, a prominent glial cell within the central nervous system (CNS), play a large role in regulating oxidative homeostasis within the developing brain and dysregulation of astrocyte  redox balance in FXS, which may contribute to oxidative stress. Astrocyte function and mitochondrial bioenergetics are significantly influenced by oxygen availability and circulating sex hormones; yet, these parameters are rarely considered during in vitro experimentation. Given that the brain normally develops in a range of hypoxic conditions and FXS is a sex-linked genetic disorder, we investigated how different oxygen levels (normoxic vs. hypoxic) and  biological sex affected mitochondrial bioenergetics of astrocytes in FXS. Our results demonstrate that both mitochondrial respiration capacity and reactive oxygen species emission are altered with Fmr1 deletion in astrocytes and these changes were dependent upon both sexual dimorphism and oxygen availability.

Among the mechanistic pathways that have been described through which maternal inflammation during pregnancy may affect fetal brain development, the role of mitochondria has received little attention. In this review, the role of mitochondria as a potential mediator of the association  between MIA during pregnancy and offspring brain development and risk for psychiatric disorders will be proposed. As a basis for this postulation, convergent evidence is presented supporting the obligatory role of mitochondria in brain development, the role of mitochondria as mediators and initiators of inflammatory processes, and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in preclinical  MIA exposure models and human neurodevelopmental disorders. Elucidating the role  of mitochondria as a potential mediator of MIA-induced alterations in brain development and neurodevelopmental disease risk may not only provide new insight  into the pathophysiology of mental health disorders that have their origins in exposure to infection/immune activation during pregnancy but also offer new therapeutic targets.

Most PWS cases are caused by paternal interstitial deletions of 15q11.2-q13.1, while a smaller number of cases are caused by chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (PW-UPD). Children with PW-UPD are at higher risk for developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than the neurotypical population. In this study, we used expression analysis of PW-UPD neurons to try to identify the  molecular cause for increased autism risk. Methods: Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) from neurotypical control and PWS subjects were differentiated to neurons for mRNA sequencing. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts among all groups were identified. Downstream protein analysis including immunocytochemistry and immunoblots were performed to confirm the transcript level data and pathway enrichment findings. Results: We identified 9 transcripts outside of the PWS critical region (15q11.2-q13.1) that may contribute to core PWS phenotypes. Moreover, we discovered a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in the PW-UPD + ASD group. We also found decreased mitochondrial abundance along with mitochondrial aggregates in the cell body and neural projections of +ASD neurons. Conclusion: The 9 transcripts we identified common to all PWS subtypes may reveal PWS specific defects during neurodevelopment. Importantly, we found a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in PW-UPD + ASD neurons versus control and other PWS subtypes. We then confirmed mitochondrial defects in neurons from individuals with PWS at the cellular level. Quantification of this phenotype supports our hypothesis that the increased incidence of ASD in PW-UPD subjects may arise from mitochondrial defects in developing neurons.

This evidence identifies oxidative stress as  a convergence point or "central hub" for schizophrenia genetic and environmental  risk factors. Here we review the existing experimental and translational research pinpointing the complex dynamics of oxidative stress mechanisms and their modulation in relation to schizophrenia pathophysiology. We focus on evidence supporting the crucial role of either redox dysregulation, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction, neuroinflammation or mitochondria bioenergetics dysfunction, initiating "vicious circles" centered on oxidative stress during neurodevelopment. These processes would amplify one another in positive feed-forward loops, leading to persistent impairments of the maturation and function of local parvalbumin-GABAergic neurons microcircuits and myelinated fibers of long-range macrocircuitry. This is at the basis of neural circuit synchronization impairments and cognitive, emotional, social and sensory deficits characteristic of schizophrenia. Potential therapeutic approaches that aim at breaking these different vicious circles represent promising strategies for timely and safe interventions. In order to improve early detection and increase the signal-to-noise ratio for adjunctive trials of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and NMDAR modulator drugs, a reverse translation of validated circuitry approach  is needed. The above presented processes allow to identify mechanism based biomarkers guiding stratification of homogenous patients groups and target engagement required for successful clinical trials, paving the way towards precision medicine in psychiatry.

We hypothesized that chronic intrauterine hypoxia (HPX) induces mitochondrial deficits by altering mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in the fetal brain. Pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to either normoxia (NMX, 21%O2) or HPX (10.5%O2) starting at 28-day (early onset, EO-HPX) or 50-day (late onset, LO-HPX) gestation until term (65 days). Near-term male and female fetuses were extracted  from anesthetized sows, and mitochondria were isolated from excised fetal forebrains (n = 6/group). Expression of mitochondrial complex subunits I-V (CI-CV), fission (Drp-1), and fusion (Mfn-2) proteins was measured by Western blot. CI and CIV enzyme activities were measured by colorimetric assays. Chronic  HPX reduced fetal body wts and increased (P < 0.05) brain/body wt ratios of both  sexes. CV subunit levels were increased in EO-HPX males only and CII levels increased in LO-HPX females only compared to NMX. Both EO- and LO-HPX decreased CIV activity in both sexes but had no effect on CI activity. EO-HPX increased Drp1 and decreased Mfn2 levels in males, while LO-HPX had no effect on either protein levels. In females, both EO-HPX and LO-HPX increased Drp1 but had no effect on Mfn2 levels. Chronic HPX alters abundance and activity of select complex subunits and shifts mitochondrial dynamics toward fission in a sex-dependent manner in the fetal guinea pig brain. This may be an underlying mechanism of reduced respiratory efficiency leading to disrupted metabolism and increased vulnerability to a second neurological injury at the time of birth in HPX fetal brains.

While the underlying molecular  mechanisms involved remain unclear, significant progress has been facilitated by  recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic technologies. Here, we review recently published ASD proteomic data and compare proteomic functional enrichment signatures with those of transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We identify canonical pathways that are consistently implicated  in ASD molecular data and find an enrichment of pathways involved in mitochondrial metabolism and neurogenesis. We identify a subset of differentially expressed proteins that are supported by ASD transcriptomic and DNA methylation data. Furthermore, these differentially expressed proteins are enriched for disease phenotype pathways associated with ASD aetiology. These proteins converge on protein-protein interaction networks that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, and inflammation, which demonstrates a link between  canonical pathways, biological processes and the ASD phenotype. This review highlights how proteomics can uncover potential molecular mechanisms to explain a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodevelopmental pathology.

Understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms remains sparse, and therapeutic options are lacking. We characterized a mouse model lacking the Cyp2u1 gene, loss of which is known to be involved in a complex form of these diseases in humans. We showed that this model partially recapitulated the clinical and biochemical phenotypes of patients. Using electron microscopy, lipidomic, and proteomic studies, we identified vitamin B2 as a substrate of the CYP2U1 enzyme, as well as coenzyme Q, neopterin, and IFN-α levels as putative biomarkers in mice and fluids obtained from the largest series of CYP2U1-mutated patients reported so far. We also confirmed brain calcifications as a potential biomarker in patients. Our results suggest that CYP2U1 deficiency disrupts mitochondrial function and impacts proper neurodevelopment, which could be prevented by folate supplementation in our mouse model, followed by a neurodegenerative process altering multiple neuronal and extraneuronal tissues.

Because prenatal TMT exposure has been reported to induce behavioral changes, this study was conducted to observe gender differences and epigenetic changes using a mouse model. In behavioral testing of offspring at 5 weeks of age, the total times spent in the center, corner, or border zones in the male prenatal TMT-exposed mice were less than those of control unexposed mice in the open-field test. Female TMT-exposed mice scored lower on total numbers of arm entries and percentages of alternations than controls in the Y-maze test with lower body weight. We found that only TMT-exposed males had fewer copies of mtDNA in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex region than controls. Additional epigenetic changes, including increased 5-methyl cytosine/5-hydroxymethyl cytosine levels in the male TMT hippocampus, were observed. After methylation binding domain (MBD) sequencing, multiple signaling pathways related to metabolism and neurodevelopment, including FoxO signaling, were identified by pathway analysis for differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Increased FOXO3 and decreased ASCL1 expression were also observed in male TMT hippocampi. This study suggests that sex differences and epigenetics  should be more carefully considered in prenatal toxicology studies.

Genetic defects affecting cytoplasmic  translation perturb synapse development, neurotransmission, and are causative of  neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome. In contrast, there is little indication that mitochondrial proteostasis, either in the form of mitochondrial protein translation and/or degradation, is required for synapse development and function. Here we focus on two genes deleted in a recurrent copy  number variation causing neurodevelopmental disorders, the 22q11.2 microdeletion  syndrome. We demonstrate that SLC25A1 and MRPL40, two genes present in the microdeleted segment and whose products localize to mitochondria, interact and are necessary for mitochondrial ribosomal integrity and proteostasis. Our Drosophila studies show that mitochondrial ribosome function is necessary for synapse neurodevelopment, function, and behavior. We propose that mitochondrial proteostasis perturbations, either by genetic or environmental factors, are a pathogenic mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The  balance between cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation, or cytoplasmic proteostasis, is required for normal synapse function and neurodevelopment. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes are necessary for two compartmentalized,  yet interdependent, forms of proteostasis. Proteostasis dependent on cytoplasmic  ribosomes is a well-established target of genetic defects that cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. Here we show that the mitochondrial ribosome is a neurodevelopmentally regulated organelle whose function is required for synapse development and function. We propose that defective mitochondrial proteostasis is a mechanism with the potential to contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.
DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.015  PMID: 34022472  [Indexed for MEDLINE]|Increased levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA in plasma of late life depression subjects.|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of late-life depression (LLD). Mitochondria are the primary source of oxidative stress and can be significantly damaged with increased OS. Circulating cell-free  mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) is a marker of cellular stress and mitochondria damage triggered by oxidative stress. METHODS: We evaluated the plasma levels of ccf-mtDNA in between 32 LLD and 21 never-depressed participants. We also investigated the association between ccf-mtDNA and the severity of depressive episodes and cognition performance. RESULTS: We found a higher ccf-mtDNA level in LLD cases compared with controls (t = -2.91, p = 0.005). Also, ccf-mtDNA was significantly correlated with the severity of depression (r = 0.42, p = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between ccf-mtDNA and measures of cognitive decline. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size and cross-sectional design were the main limitations of this study. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that LLD is associated with elevated mitochondrial damage and cellular stress. If validated, the measurement of ccf-mtDNA in LLD can guide the development of novel treatments focused on cytoprotection and reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction for this condition.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a naturally occurring saturated N-acylethanolamine that has proven to be effective  in controlling inflammation, depression, epilepsy, and pain, possibly through a neuroprotective role against glutamate toxicity. Here, we systematically reviewed all human and animal studies examining PEA and its biobehavioral correlates in ASD. Studies indicate altered serum/brain levels of PEA and other endocannabinoids (ECBs)/acylethanolamines (AEs) in ASD. Altered PEA signaling response to social exposure and altered expression/activity of enzymes responsible for the synthesis and catalysis of ECBs/AEs, as well as downregulation of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) and cannabinoid receptor target GPR55 mRNA brain expression, have been reported. Stress and exposure to exogenous cannabinoids may modulate ECBs/AEs levels and expression of candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, with implications for ASD. Limited research suggests that PEA supplementation reduces overall autism severity by improving language and social and nonsocial behaviors. Potential neurobiological underpinnings include modulation of immune response, neuroinflammation, neurotrophy, apoptosis, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial function, and microbiota activity, possibly through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) activation.

This study investigates the cytotoxic effects, genetic effects, and metabolic effects from exposure to low concentration TBBPA. The cell exposure was measured by mimicking the residual TBBPA concentrations in human plasma, specifically in occupational populations. Our results revealed that long-term TBBPA exposure, especially at 1 nM concentration, significantly promoted the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Furthermore, long-term TBBPA exposure can double the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from mitochondria, thereby increasing Adenosine Monophosphate activated Protein kinase (AMPK) gene expression level to promote cellular proliferation. However, ROS can also mediate the apoptosis process through the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the Ras signaling pathway was activated by the growth factor to mediate cell detoxification mechanism, increasing lipid and vitamin metabolic rate. Our work uncovers a cellular mechanism by which long-term exposure to low concentration TBBPA can induce the activation of the Ras signaling pathway and demonstrates potential metabolic disorder in the human hepatic cells upon plasma TBBPA exposure.

Air pollution comprises particulate matter (PM), metals, black carbon and gases such as ozone (O3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO). In addition to respiratory and cardiovascular disease,  PM exposure is linked with increased risk of neurodegeneration as well as neurodevelopmental impairments. Critically, studies suggest that PM crosses the placenta, making direct in utero exposure a reality. Rodent models reveal that neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalance and oxidative stress are triggered  following gestational/early life exposure to PM, and may be exacerbated by concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction. Gestational PM exposure (potentiated by mitochondrial impairment in the metabolically active neonatal brain) not only impacts neurodevelopment but may sensitise the brain to subsequent cognitive impairment. Having reviewed this field, we conclude that strategies are urgently  required to reduce exposure to PM during this sensitive developmental period.

Although the pivotal role of mitochondria in neurogenesis was demonstrated (first in animal models), very little is known about their role in human embryonic neurodevelopment and its pathology. In this respect human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived cerebral organoids provide a tractable, alternative model system of the early neural development and disease that is responsive to pharmacological and genetic manipulations, not possible to apply in humans. Although the involvement of mitochondria in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and brain dysfunction  has been demonstrated, the precise role they play in cell life and death remains  unknown, compromising the development of new mitochondria-targeted approaches to  treat human diseases. The cerebral organoid model of neurogenesis and disease in  vitro provides an unprecedented opportunity to answer some of the most fundamental questions about mitochondrial function in early human neurodevelopment and neural pathology. Largely an unexplored territory due to the lack of tools and approaches, this review focuses on recent technological advancements in fluorescent and molecular tools, imaging systems, and computational approaches for quantitative and qualitative analyses of mitochondrial structure and function in three-dimensional cellular assemblies-cerebral organoids. Future developments in this direction will further facilitate our understanding of the important role or mitochondrial dynamics and  energy requirements during early embryonic development. This in turn will provide a further understanding of how dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to disease processes.

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to  examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the  system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation,  calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each  experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis,  not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.

We treated male Wistar rat puppies (P) with rotenone (Rot), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, from postnatal days 5 to 11 (P5-P11). We demonstrated that at P60 and P120, Rot-treated animals showed hyperlocomotion and deficits in social interaction and aversive contextual memory, features observed  in animal models of schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. During adulthood, Rot-treated rodents also presented modifications in CBP and CREB levels in addition to a decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis and Nrf1 expression. Additionally, NFE2L2-activation was not altered in Rot-treated P60 and P120 animals; an upregulation of pNFE2L2/ NFE2L2 was only observed in P12 cortices. Curiously, ATP/ADP levels did not change in all ages evaluated. Rot administration in newborn rodents also promoted modification in Rest and Mecp2 expression, and in synaptic protein levels, named  PSD-95, Synaptotagmin-1, and Synaptophysin in the adult rats. Altogether, our data indicate that behavioral abnormalities and changes in synaptic proteins in adulthood induced by neonatal Rot administration might be a result of adjustments in CREB pathways and alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis and Nrf1 expression, rather than a direct deficiency of energy supply, as previously speculated. Consequently, Rot-induced psychiatric-like behavior would be an outcome of alterations in neuronal paths due to mitochondrial deregulation.

Mitochondria not only provide neurons with energy in the form of ATP to sustain neuron growth, proliferation and neurodevelopment, but also regulate neuron apoptosis, intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) homeostasis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance. Due to their postmitotic state and high energy-demanded feature, neurons are particularly prone to mitophagy and mitochondrial disfunction. Mitophagy, a selective autophagy, is critical for sustaining mitochondrial turnover and quality control via eliminating unwanted and dysfunctional mitochondria in neurons. Dysfunctional mitochondria and dysregulated mitophagy have been closely associated with the onset of ASDs. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of mitophagy and its role in neurons, and the consequence of mitophagy dysfunction in ASDs. Deeper appreciation of the role of mitophagy in ASDs pathology is required for developing new therapeutic approaches.
Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could  be construed as a potential conflict of interest.|The Parvalbumin Hypothesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.|The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-a type of neurodevelopmental disorder-is increasing and is around 2% in North America, Asia, and Europe. Besides the known genetic link, environmental, epigenetic, and metabolic factors  have been implicated in ASD etiology. Although highly heterogeneous at the behavioral level, ASD comprises a set of core symptoms including impaired communication and social interaction skills as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. This has led to the suggestion that a large part of the ASD phenotype  is caused by changes in a few and common set of signaling pathways, the identification of which is a fundamental aim of autism research. Using advanced bioinformatics tools and the abundantly available genetic data, it is possible to classify the large number of ASD-associated genes according to cellular function  and pathways. Cellular processes known to be impaired in ASD include gene regulation, synaptic transmission affecting the excitation/inhibition balance, neuronal Ca2+ signaling, development of short-/long-range connectivity (circuits  and networks), and mitochondrial function. Such alterations often occur during early postnatal neurodevelopment. Among the neurons most affected in ASD as well  as in schizophrenia are those expressing the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). These mainly inhibitory interneurons present in many different brain regions in humans and rodents are characterized by rapid, non-adaptive firing and have a high energy requirement. PV expression is often reduced at both messenger  RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in human ASD brain samples and mouse ASD (and schizophrenia) models. Although the human PVALB gene is not a high-ranking susceptibility/risk gene for either disorder and is currently only listed in the  SFARI Gene Archive, we propose and present supporting evidence for the Parvalbumin Hypothesis, which posits that decreased PV level is causally related  to the etiology of ASD (and possibly schizophrenia).

The fundamental features of in-utero brain development, including local synaptic E-I ratio and bioenergetics, can be modeled by cerebral organoids  (CO) that have exhibited highly regular nested oscillatory network events. Therefore, we evaluated a 'Phase Zero' clinical study platform combining broadband Vis/near-infrared(NIR) spectroscopy and electrophysiology with studying E-I ratio based on the spectral exponent of local field potentials and bioenergetics based on the activity of mitochondrial Cytochrome-C Oxidase (CCO).  We found a significant effect of the age of the healthy controls iPSC CO from 23 days to 3 months on the CCO activity (chi-square (2, N = 10) = 20, p = 4.5400e-05), and spectral exponent between 30-50 Hz (chi-square (2, N = 16) = 13.88, p = 0.001). Also, a significant effect of drugs, choline (CHO),  idebenone (IDB), R-alpha-lipoic acid plus acetyl-L-carnitine (LCLA), was found on the CCO activity (chi-square (3, N = 10) = 25.44, p = 1.2492e-05), spectral exponent between 1 and 20 Hz (chi-square (3, N = 16) = 43.5, p = 1.9273e-09) and  30-50 Hz (chi-square (3, N = 16) = 23.47, p = 3.2148e-05) in 34 days old CO from  schizophrenia (SCZ) patients iPSC. We present the feasibility of a multimodal approach, combining electrophysiology and broadband Vis-NIR spectroscopy, to monitor neurodevelopment in brain organoid models that can complement traditional drug design approaches to test clinically meaningful hypotheses.

These changes are rather disturbing, as similar  changes are seen in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders. We previously  suggested that mTor-dependent upregulation of mitochondrial function may be involved in such changes. To further understand the significance of mitochondrial changes after general anesthesia during neurodevelopment, we exposed young mice to 2.5 % sevoflurane for 2 h followed by injection of rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. In postnatal day 17 (PND17) mice, intraperitoneal injection  of rotenone not only blocked sevoflurane-induced increases in mitochondrial function, it also prevented sevoflurane-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission. Interestingly, similar changes were not observed in younger, neonatal mice (PND7). We next assessed whether the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) acted as a link between anesthetic exposure and mitochondrial function. Expression of UPRmt proteins, which help maintain protein-folding homeostasis and increase mitochondrial function, was increased 6 h after sevoflurane exposure. Our results show that a single, brief sevoflurane exposure  induces age-dependent changes in mitochondrial function that constitute an important mechanism for the increase in excitatory synaptic transmission in late  postnatal mice, and also suggest mitochondria and UPRmt as potential targets for  preventing anesthesia toxicity.

AGC1 deficiency is a neuropediatric rare disease characterized by hypomyelination, hypotonia, developmental arrest, and epilepsy. We have investigated whether β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), the main ketone body (KB) produced in ketogenic diet (KD), is neuroprotective in aralar-knock-out (KO) neurons and mice. We report that βOHB efficiently recovers aralar-KO neurons from deficits in basal-stimulated and glutamate-stimulated respiration, effects requiring βOHB entry into the neuron, and protects from glutamate excitotoxicity. Aralar-deficient mice were fed a KD to investigate its therapeutic potential early in development, but this approach was unfeasible. Therefore, aralar-KO pups were treated without distinction of gender with daily intraperitoneal injections  of βOHB during 5 d. This treatment resulted in a recovery of striatal markers of  the dopaminergic system including dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/DA ratio, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) protein. Regarding postnatal myelination, myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) myelin proteins were markedly increased in the cortices of βOHB-treated aralar-KO mice. Although brain Asp and NAA levels did not change by  βOHB administration, a 4-d βOHB treatment to aralar-KO, but not to control, neurons led to a substantial increase in Asp (3-fold) and NAA (4-fold) levels. These results suggest that the lack of increase in brain Asp and NAA is possibly  because of its active utilization by the aralar-KO brain and the likely involvement of neuronal NAA in postnatal myelination in these mice. The effectiveness of βOHB as a therapeutic treatment in AGC1 deficiency deserves further investigation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Aralar deficiency induces a fatal phenotype in humans and mice and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment, epilepsy, and hypomyelination. In neurons, highly expressing aralar, its deficiency causes a metabolic blockade hampering mitochondrial energetics and respiration. Here, we find that βOHB, the main metabolic product in KD, recovers  defective mitochondrial respiration bypassing the metabolic failure in aralar-deficient neurons. βOHB oxidation in mitochondria boosts the synthesis of  cytosolic aspartate (Asp) and NAA, which is impeded by aralar deficiency, presumably through citrate-malate shuttle. In aralar-knock-out (KO) mice, βOHB recovers from the drastic drop in specific dopaminergic and myelin markers. The βOHB-induced myelin synthesis occurring together with the marked increment in neuronal NAA synthesis supports the role of NAA as a lipid precursor during postnatal myelination.

Mitochondrial function was assessed using the Seahorse XFe96 in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Second and third trimester average and maximal daily exposure to fine air particulate matter of diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) was obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System. Neurodevelopment was measured using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 2nd edition and behavior was assessed using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Social Responsiveness Scale. Prenatal PM2.5 exposure influenced mitochondrial respiration during childhood, but this relationship was different for those with  (r = 0.25-0.40) and without (r = -0.07 to -0.19) NDR. Mediation analysis found that mitochondrial respiration linked to energy production accounted for 25% (SD = 2%) and 10% (SD = 2%) of the effect of average prenatal PM2.5 exposure on neurodevelopment and behavioral symptoms, respectively. Structural equation models estimated that PM2.5 and mitochondrial respiration accounted for 34% (SD = 4%) and 36% (SD = 3%) of the effect on neurodevelopment, respectively, and  that behavior was indirectly influenced by mitochondrial respiration through neurodevelopment but directly influenced by prenatal PM2.5. Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to PM2.5 disrupts neurodevelopment and behavior through complex mechanisms, including long-term changes in mitochondrial respiration and  that patterns of early development need to be considered when studying the influence of environmental agents on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

The study of the development of epilepsy and hyperexcitability states involves molecular, synaptic, and structural alterations of neuronal bioelectric activity. In this paper we aim to explore the neurobiological targets involved in microtubule functioning and cytoskeletal transport, i.e. how dynamic scaffolding of microtubules can influence neuronal morphology and excitability, in order to suggest a potential role for microtubule dynamics in the processes turning a normal neuronal network in a hyperexcited one. Pathophysiological alterations of microtubule dynamics inducing neurodegeneration, network remodeling and relative impairment on synaptic transmission were overviewed. Recent researches were reported on the phosphorylation state of microtubule-associated proteins such as tau in neurodegenerative diseases and epileptic states, but also on the effect of microtubule-active agents influencing cytoskeleton destabilization in epilepsy models. The manipulation of microtubule polymerization was found effective in the modulation of hyperexcitability. In addition, it was considered the importance of microtubules and related neurotrophic factors during neural development since they are essential for the formation of a properly functional neuronal network. Otherwise, this can lead to cognitive deficits, hyperexcitability phenomena and neurodevelopmental disorders. Lastly, we evaluated the role of microtubule dynamics on neuronal efficiency considering their importance in the transport of  mitochondria, cellular elements fulfilling energy requirements for neuronal activity, and a putative influence on cannabinoid-mediated neuroprotection. This  review provides novel perspectives for the implication of microtubule dynamics in the development of epileptic phenomena.

However, the molecular mechanisms for oligodendrocyte maturational failure remain unclear. In  neonatal mice and cultured differentiating oligodendrocytes, sublethal intermittent hypoxic (IH) stress activated cyclophilin D-dependent mitochondrial  proton leak and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, leading to transient bioenergetic stress. This was associated with development of diffuse WMI: poor oligodendrocyte maturation, diffuse axonal hypomyelination, and permanent sensorimotor deficit. In normoxic mice and oligodendrocytes, exposure to a mitochondrial uncoupler recapitulated the phenotype of WMI, supporting the detrimental role of mitochondrial uncoupling in the pathogenesis of WMI. Compared with WT mice, cyclophilin D-knockout littermates did not develop bioenergetic stress in response to IH challenge and fully preserved oligodendrocyte maturation, axonal myelination, and neurofunction. Our study identified the cyclophilin D-dependent mitochondrial proton leak and uncoupling as a potentially novel subcellular mechanism for the maturational failure of oligodendrocytes and  offers a potential therapeutic target for prevention of diffuse WMI in premature  infants experiencing chronic IH stress.

Certain classes of pharmaceuticals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are a major environmental concern due to their widespread use and the fact that these compounds are designed to have biological effects at low doses. A complication in predicting toxic effects of SSRIs in nontarget organisms is that their mechanism  of action is not fully understood. To better understand the potential toxic effects of SSRIs, we employed an ultra-low input RNA-sequencing method to identify potential pathways that are affected by early exposure to two SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine). We exposed wildtype zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  to 100 μg/L of either fluoxetine or paroxetine for 6 days before extracting and sequencing mRNA from individual larval brains. Differential gene expression analysis identified 1550 genes that were significantly affected by SSRI exposure  with a core set of 138 genes altered by both SSRIs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 7 modules of genes whose expression patterns were significantly correlated with SSRI exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes as well as network module genes repeatedly identified various terms associated with mitochondrial and neuronal structures, mitochondrial respiration, and neurodevelopmental processes. The enrichment of these terms indicates that toxic effects of SSRI exposure are likely caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to study the tissue-specific transcriptomic effects of SSRIs in developing zebrafish, providing specific, high resolution molecular data regarding the sublethal effects of SSRI exposure.

Here we found that treatment with triiodothyronine (T3) ameliorated the progression of neurological deficits in mice subjected to TBI. The data showed that T3 reduced neural death and promoted the elimination of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy.  However, T3 did not prevent TBI-induced cell death in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) knockout mice suggesting the involvement of mitophagy. Moreover, we also found that T3 promoted neurogenesis via crosstalk between mature neurons and neural stem cells (NSCs) after TBI. In neuron cultures undergoing oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), conditioned neuron culture medium collected after T3 treatment enhanced the in vitro differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons, a process in which mitophagy was required. Taken together, these data suggested that T3 treatment could provide a  therapeutic approach for TBI by preventing neuronal death via mitophagy and promoting neurogenesis via neuron-NSC crosstalk.

Previous research has demonstrated that mitochondrial damage plays an important role in BaP-induced neurotoxicity. Of interest, increasing evidence has suggested that resveratrol (RSV) can alleviate  nerve cell damage, however the exact mechanisms of biological activity in mitochondria are not fully understood. In the current study, Wistar rats were exposed to BaP (1, 2, 4 mg/kg) and/or RSV (15, 30 mg/kg) during embryonic development and adolescence, and learning and memory ability, mitochondrial damage, and the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy were evaluated. These studies indicated that 2 and 4 mg/kg BaP could induce disorders of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, which leads to  abnormal nerve cell development. However, pretreatment with 30 mg/kg RSV alleviated cell damage and the disorder of mitochondrial biogenesis by activating the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway and promoting mitophagy. These findings suggested that RSV had utility in promoting mitochondrial homeostasis against BaP-induced nerve cell damage in the hippocampus of rats.

One such role is the regulation and sequestration of calcium, which is done with the help of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and its regulators, MICU1 and MICU2. Genetic variations in MICU1 and MICU2 have been reported to cause myopathy, developmental disability and neurological symptoms typical of mitochondrial disorders. The symptoms of MICU1/2 deficiency have generally been attributed to calcium regulation in the metabolic and biochemical roles of mitochondria. Here, we report a female child with heterozygous MICU1 variants and multiple congenital brain malformations on MRI. Specifically, she shows anterior perisylvian polymicrogyria, dysmorphic basal ganglia, and cerebellar dysplasia in addition to white matter abnormalities. These novel findings suggest that MICU1 is necessary for proper neurodevelopment through a variety of potential mechanisms, including calcium-mediated regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton, Miro1-MCU complex-mediated mitochondrial movement, or enhancing ATP production. This case provides new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MCU dysfunction and may represent a novel diagnostic feature of calcium-based mitochondrial disease.

How mitochondrial dysfunction affects neural structure and function remains elusive, mostly because of a lack of proper in vitro neuronal model systems with  mitochondrial dysfunction. Leveraging induced pluripotent stem cell technology, we differentiated excitatory cortical neurons (iNeurons) with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function on an isogenic nuclear DNA background from patients with the common pathogenic m.3243A  > G variant of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like  episodes (MELAS). iNeurons with high heteroplasmy exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, delayed neural maturation, reduced dendritic complexity, and fewer excitatory synapses. Micro-electrode array recordings of neuronal networks displayed reduced network activity and decreased synchronous network bursting. Impaired neuronal energy metabolism and compromised structural and functional integrity of neurons and neural networks could be the primary drivers of increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disease.
Conflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.|SIRT1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis supports therapeutic effects of resveratrol against neurodevelopment damage by fluoride.|Rationale: Potential adverse effects of fluoride on neurodevelopment has been extensively explored and mitochondria have been recognized as critical targets. Mitochondrial biogenesis serves a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and salubrious properties of resveratrol (RSV) has been well-defined. However, the molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial biogenesis in developmental fluoride neurotoxicity remain unclear and the related therapeutic dietary agent is lacking. Methods: In vitro neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in vivo Sprague-Dawley rat model of developmental fluoride exposure were adopted. A  total population of 60 children under long-term stable fluoride exposure were also recruited. This work used a combination of biochemical and behavioral techniques. Biochemical methods included analysis of mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as mRNA and protein expression of mitochondrial biogenesis signaling molecules, including silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Behavioral studies investigated spatial learning and memory ability of rats. Results: Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that sodium fluoride (NaF)  caused mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis. Also, NaF elevated SIRT1 levels and suppressed SIRT1 deacetylase activity along with decreased levels of PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM, suggestive of dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis signaling molecules. Moreover, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis by TFAM overexpression alleviated NaF-induced neuronal death through improving mitochondrial function in vitro. Further in vivo and in vitro studies identified RSV, the strongest specific SIRT1 activator, improved mitochondrial biogenesis and subsequent mitochondrial function to protect against developmental fluoride neurotoxicity via activating SIRT1-dependent PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM signaling pathway. Noteworthy, epidemiological data indicated intimate correlations between disturbed circulating levels of mitochondrial biogenesis signaling molecules and fluoride-caused intellectual loss in children. Conclusions: Our data suggest the pivotal role of impaired mitochondrial biogenesis in developmental fluoride neurotoxicity and the underlying SIRT1 signaling dysfunction in such neurotoxic process, which emphasizes RSV as a potential therapeutic dietary agent for relieving developmental fluoride neurotoxicity.

The full mutation results in transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene and loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. Defects in neuroenergetic capacity are known to cause a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, we explored the integrity of forebrain mitochondria in Fmr1 knockout mice during the peak of synaptogenesis. We found inefficient thermogenic respiration due to futile proton leak in Fmr1 KO mitochondria caused by coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency and an open cyclosporine-sensitive channel. Repletion of mitochondrial CoQ within the Fmr1 KO forebrain closed the channel, blocked the pathological proton leak, restored rates of protein synthesis during synaptogenesis, and normalized the key phenotypic features later in life. The findings demonstrate that FMRP deficiency  results in inefficient oxidative phosphorylation during the neurodevelopment and  suggest that dysfunctional mitochondria may contribute to the FXS phenotype.

METHODS: Cerebral organoids were generated from iPSCs of eight bipolar disorder (BPI) patients and eight healthy control individuals. RNA-seq experiments were undertaken using RNA isolated from the cerebral organoids. Functional activity in the cerebral organoids was studied using microelectrode arrays. RESULTS: RNA-seq data comparing gene expression profiles in the cerebral organoids showed downregulation of pathways involved in cell adhesion, neurodevelopment, and synaptic biology in bipolar disorder along with upregulation of genes involved in immune signaling. The central hub in the network analysis was neurocan (NCAN), which is located in a locus with evidence for genome-wide significant association in BPI. Gene ontology analyses suggested  deficits related to endoplasmic reticulum biology in BPI, which was supported by  cellular characterization of ER-mitochondria interactions. Functional studies with microelectrode arrays revealed specific deficits in response to stimulation  and depolarization in BPI cerebral organoids. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies in cerebral organoids from bipolar disorder showed dysregulation in genes involved in cell adhesion, immune signaling, and endoplasmic reticulum biology; implicated a central role for the GWAS hit NCAN in the biology of BPI; and showed evidence of deficits in neurotransmission.

A disease model of dysregulated energy expenditure.|Advances in the understanding and management of bipolar disorder (BD) have been slow to emerge. Despite notable recent developments in neurosciences, our conceptualization of the nature of this mental disorder has not meaningfully progressed. One of the key reasons for this scenario is the continuing lack of a  comprehensive disease model. Within the increasing complexity of modern research  methods, there is a clear need for an overarching theoretical framework, in which findings are assimilated and predictions are generated. In this review and hypothesis article, we propose such a framework, one in which dysregulated energy expenditure is a primary, sufficient cause for BD. Our proposed model is centered on the disruption of the molecular and cellular network regulating energy production and expenditure, as well its potential secondary adaptations and compensatory mechanisms. We also focus on the putative longitudinal progression of this pathological process, considering its most likely periods for onset, such as critical periods that challenges energy homeostasis (e.g. neurodevelopment, social isolation), and the resulting short and long-term phenotypical manifestations.

Objective: To determine transcriptomic profiles and functional characteristics of cerebral organoids from patients with schizophrenia using gene expression studies, complemented with investigations of mitochondrial function through measurement of real-time oxygen consumption rate, and functional studies of neuronal firing with microelectrode arrays. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital between 2017 and 2019. Transcriptomic profiling of iPSC-derived cerebral organoids from 8 patients with schizophrenia and 8 healthy  control individuals was undertaken to identify cellular pathways that are aberrant in schizophrenia. Induced pluripotent stem cells and cerebral organoids  were generated from patients who had been diagnosed as having schizophrenia and from heathy control individuals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Transcriptomic analysis of iPSC-derived cerebral organoids from patients with schizophrenia show differences in expression of genes involved in synaptic biology and neurodevelopment and are enriched for genes implicated in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Results: The study included iPSC lines generated from 11 male and 5 female white  participants, with a mean age of 38.8 years. RNA sequencing data from iPSC-derived cerebral organoids in schizophrenia showed differential expression of genes involved in synapses, in nervous system development, and in antigen processing. The differentially expressed genes were enriched for genes implicated in schizophrenia, with 23% of GWAS genes showing differential expression in schizophrenia and control organoids: 10 GWAS genes were upregulated in schizophrenia organoids while 15 GWAS genes were downregulated. Analysis of the gene expression profiles suggested dysregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial function and those involved in modulation of excitatory and inhibitory pathways. Studies of mitochondrial respiration showed lower basal consumption rate, adenosine triphosphate production, proton leak, and nonmitochondrial oxygen consumption in schizophrenia cerebral organoids, without  any differences in the extracellular acidification rate. Microelectrode array studies of cerebral organoids showed no differences in baseline electrical activity in schizophrenia but revealed a diminished response to stimulation and depolarization. Conclusions and Relevance: Investigations of patient-derived cerebral organoids in schizophrenia revealed gene expression patterns suggesting dysregulation of a  number of pathways in schizophrenia, delineated differences in mitochondrial function, and showed deficits in response to stimulation and depolarization in schizophrenia.

Glucocorticoids have a broad effect in the body, modifying  the activity of the immune system, metabolism, and behavior through the activation of receptors in the limbic system. Chronic exposition to stressors operates as a risk factor for psychiatric diseases such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Among the cellular alterations observed as a consequence of environmental stress, alterations to organelle function at the level of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are emerging as possible factors contributing to neuronal dysfunction. ER proteostasis alterations elicit  the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling network that re-establish protein homeostasis. In addition, in the context of brain function,  the UPR has been associated to neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity. Recent studies suggest a role of the UPR in the adaptive behavior to stress, suggesting a mechanistic link between environmental and cellular stress. Here, we revise recent evidence supporting an evolutionary connection between the neuroendocrine system and the UPR to modulate behavioral adaptive responses.

These model systems have provided the fundamental understanding of general principles of development, as well as insight into genes and signaling pathways that control unique aspects of cell fate specification and tissue morphogenesis.  Because human brain development cannot be studied in vivo, scientists have relied on these model systems to study basic principles underlying the development of this complex organ as many of these genes and signaling pathways play conserved roles in human development. However, recent studies have shown species-specific signatures in neurodevelopment such as the transcriptome of outer-radial glia, suggesting use of a human-derived model remains imperative. Over the past decade, human stem cell-derived brain organoids have emerged as a biologically relevant model system to study normal human brain development and neurological diseases. Here, we provide a historical perspective of this emerging model system, discuss  current systems and limitations, and propose that new mechanistic insight into cell biology can be revealed using these three-dimensional brain structures.

In this study, we investigate the role of miR-137, a brain-enriched miRNA, in determining the fate of human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived NSCs (hiNSCs). We show that ectopic expression of miR-137 in hiNSCs reduces proliferation and accelerates neuronal differentiation and migration. TargetScan and MicroT-CDS predict myocyte enhancer factor-2A (MEF2A), a transcription factor that regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC1α) transcription, as a target of miR-137. Using a reporter assay, we validate MEF2A  as a downstream target of miR-137. Our results indicate that reduced levels of MEF2A reduce the transcription of PGC1α, which in turn impacts mitochondrial dynamics. Notably, miR-137 accelerates mitochondrial biogenesis in a PGC1α independent manner by upregulating nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) and transcription factor A of mitochondria (TFAM). In addition, miR-137 modulates mitochondrial dynamics by inducing mitochondrial fusion and fission events, resulting in increased mitochondrial content and activation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and oxygen consumption rate. Pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and SOX2 are known to have binding sites in the promoter region of miR-137 gene. Ectopic expression of miR-137 elevates the expression levels of OCT4 and SOX2 in hiNSCs which establishes a feed-forward self-regulatory loop between miR-137 and OCT4/SOX2. Our study provides novel molecular insights into NSC fate determination by miR-137.

Alteration of lipid metabolism has been demonstrated in many neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) is an active alkaloid ingredient in the traditional Chinese medicine Uncaria hook. It has been shown that GM has strong potency in neuroprotective activity and GM reduces the production of reactive oxygen species by regulating glucose metabolism, which protects neurons against oxidative stress-induced cell death. However, it is unknown whether GM could regulate neuronal lipid metabolism during oxidative challenge. AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study aimed to explore whether GM regulates lipid metabolism in oxidative damaged neurons and to determine the underlying mechanism involved in this neuro-protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity model in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT-22 cells), we investigated the effect of GM on glutamate-induced lipid peroxidation, lipotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the neuroprotection by  GM, lipid metabolomics was performed to investigate whether GM prevent oxidative  stress-induced lipid metabolism disruption. Furthermore, the expression of lipid  metabolism-related genes was measured. RESULTS: The results show the protective effect of GM against oxidative stress through blocking glutamate-induced lipid peroxidation and lipotoxicity. Overall,  lipidomics analysis revealed that glutamate treatment resulted in different extents of changes in a wide range of lipid classes such as fatty acids (FA), triacylglycerol (TG), sphingomyelin (SM), cardiolipin (CL), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC). However, GM treatment can significantly reverse glutamate-induced lipids disorder to the homeostasis level. GM prevented the disruption of lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of lipid homeostasis  related genes, which contributes to preserve mitochondrial function under oxidative damage. CONCLUSION: These findings clearly demonstrated a novel protective mechanism of GM against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in neurons via regulating lipid metabolism. GM may provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of oxidative damaged neurons.

Mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics are required for the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. However,  little is known about how PBDEs disrupt this dynamics and whether such disruption contributes to impaired neurodevelopment. Methods: We investigated the effects of 2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE-47), the dominant congener in human samples, on mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics using PC12 cells, a well-defined in vitro neurodevelopmental model. We also evaluated the effects of  perinatal low-dose PBDE-47 exposure on hippocampal mitochondrial dynamics and its association with neurobehavioral changes in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Results: In vitro, PBDE-47 disrupted mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting mitochondrial fusion and fission simultaneously, accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, membrane potential dissipation, ATP loss, and apoptosis activation. Specifically, enhancing mitochondrial fusion by the chemical promoter M1 or adenovirus-mediated mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) overexpression rescued PBDE-47-caused mitochondrial dynamic, morphological and functional impairments, prevented the resultant apoptosis and promoted neuronal survival. Unexpectedly, either stimulating mitochondrial fission by adenovirus-mediated fission protein 1 (Fis1) overexpression or suppressing mitochondrial fission by the mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) failed to reverse whereas aggravated PBDE-47-induced mitochondrial damage and neuronal death. Importantly, promoting mitochondrial fusion by Mfn2 overexpression neutralized the detrimental effects elicited by Fis1 overexpression after PBDE-47 treatment. Finally, perinatal oral administration of PBDE-47 elicited neurobehavioral deficits and hippocampal neuronal loss via apoptosis in adult rats, which were associated with mitochondrial dynamics alterations manifested as a fragmented phenotype. Conclusion: Our results suggest that PBDE-47 disrupts mitochondrial dynamics to induce mitochondrial abnormalities, triggering apoptosis and thus contributing to neuronal loss and subsequent neurobehavioral deficits. Targeting mitochondrial fusion may be a promising therapeutic intervention against PBDE-47 neurotoxicity.

It is now clear that the maturation of neural stem cells to neurones, fully integrated into neuronal circuits requires a complete remodelling of cellular metabolism, including switching the cellular energy source. Mitochondria are central for this transition and are increasingly seen as the regulatory hub in defining neural stem cell fate and neurodevelopment. This review explores our current knowledge of metabolism during adult neurodifferentiation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PPA on mitochondrial function and gene expression in neuronal cells. SH-SY5Y cells and normal human neural progenitor (NHNP) cells were exposed to 1, 5 mM PPA for 4 or 24 h and we found that the mitochondrial potential measured in SH-SY5Y cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner after PPA treatment. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the size of the mitochondria was significantly reduced following PPA treatment. A dose-dependent  increase in the mitochondrial DNA copy number was observed in the PPA-treated cells. The expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins PGC-1α, TFAM, SIRT3, and COX4 was significantly increased after PPA treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that mRNA expression in the notch signaling-related genes ASCL1 and LFNG changed after PPA treatment and the positive correlated protein expression changes were also observed. These results  revealed that PPA treatment may affect neurodevelopment by altering mitochondrial function and notch signaling-related gene expression.

Although ART has successfully aided in the decline of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV, the long-term effects of in utero exposure to ART on fetal and postnatal neurodevelopment remain unclear. Evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutic drugs for pregnant women is a challenge due to the historic limitations on their inclusion in clinical trials and the dynamic physiological states during pregnancy that can alter the pharmacokinetics of drug metabolism and fetal drug exposure. Thus, much of our data on the potential consequences of  ART drugs on the developing nervous system comes from preclinical animal models and clinical observational studies. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge and existing approaches to investigate whether ART affects fetal brain development, and describe novel human stem cell-based strategies that may provide additional information to better predict the impact of specific drugs on the human central nervous system. Graphical Abstract Approaches to evaluate the impact of drugs on the developing brain. Dysregulation of the developing nervous system can lead to long-lasting changes. Integration of data from animal  models, clinical observations, and cell culture studies is needed to predict the  safety of therapeutic antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. New approaches include human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based 2D and 3D models of neuronal networks and brain regions, as well as single cell profiling in response to drug exposure.

Autophagy is particularly important in neurons, which are terminally differentiated cells that must last the lifetime of the organism. There are both constitutive and stress-induced pathways for autophagy in neurons, which catalyze the turnover of aged or damaged mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, other cellular organelles, and aggregated proteins. These pathways are required in neurodevelopment as well as in the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis. Here we review the core components of the pathway for autophagosome  biogenesis, as well as the cell biology of bulk and selective autophagy in neurons. Finally, we discuss the role of autophagy in neuronal development, homeostasis, and aging and the links between deficits in autophagy and neurodegeneration.

Faster induction times and quicker recovery periods of current anesthetic agents have also helped reduce health care costs significantly. Moreover, extensive research has allowed for a better understanding of anesthetic modes of action, thus facilitating the development of more effective and safer compounds. Notwithstanding the realization that anesthetics are a prerequisite to all surgical procedures, evidence is emerging to support the notion that exposure of the developing brain to certain anesthetics may impact future brain development and function. Whereas the data in support of this postulate from human studies is equivocal, the vast majority of animal research strongly suggests that anesthetics are indeed cytotoxic at multiple brain structure and function levels. In this review, we first highlight various modes of anesthetic action and then debate the evidence of harm from both basic science and clinical  studies perspectives. We present evidence from animal and human studies vis-à-vis the possible detrimental effects of anesthetic agents on both the young developing and the elderly aging brain while discussing potential ways to mitigate these effects. We hope that this review will, on the one hand, invoke debate vis-à-vis the evidence of anesthetic harm in young children and the elderly, and on the other hand, incentivize the search for better and less toxic  anesthetic compounds.

We used existing sequencing-based methylation data, which assayed the majority of all 28 million CpGs in the human genome, to perform an MWAS for schizophrenia in blood, while controlling for cell-type heterogeneity with a recently generated platform-specific reference panel. Next, we compared the MWAS results with findings from 3 existing large-scale array-based schizophrenia methylation studies in blood that assayed up to ~450 000 CpGs. Our  MWAS identified 22 highly significant loci (P < 5 × 10-8) and 852 suggestively significant loci (P < 1 × 10-5). The top finding (P = 5.62 × 10-11, q = 0.001) was located in MFN2, which encodes mitofusin-2 that regulates Ca2+ transfer from  the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria in cooperation with DISC1. The second-most significant site (P = 1.38 × 10-9, q = 0.013) was located in ALDH1A2, which encodes an enzyme for astrocyte-derived retinoic acid-a key neuronal morphogen with relevance for schizophrenia. Although the most significant MWAS findings were not assayed on the arrays, we observed significant enrichment of overlapping findings with 2 of the 3 array datasets (P = 0.0315, 0.0045, 0.1946). Overrepresentation analysis of Gene Ontology terms for the genes in the significant overlaps suggested high similarity in the biological functions detected by the different datasets. Top terms were related to immune and/or stress responses, cell adhesion and motility, and a broad range of processes essential for neurodevelopment.

Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis has been highlighted as a crucial cofactor in its etiology. Here, we show that PD patient-specific human neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs), carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation, recapitulate key mitochondrial defects previously described only in differentiated dopaminergic neurons. By combining high-content imaging approaches, 3D image analysis, and functional mitochondrial readouts we show that LRRK2-G2019S mutation causes aberrations in mitochondrial morphology and functionality compared with isogenic controls. LRRK2-G2019S NESCs display an increased number of mitochondria compared with isogenic control lines. However, these mitochondria are more fragmented and exhibit decreased membrane potential. Functional alterations in LRRK2-G2019S cultures are also accompanied by a reduced mitophagic clearance via lysosomes. These findings support the hypothesis that preceding mitochondrial developmental  defects contribute to the manifestation of the PD pathology later in life.

Additional studies have revealed that Ambra1 is able to coordinate cell responses to stress conditions such as starvation, and it actively participates in cell proliferation, cytoskeletal modification, apoptosis, mitochondria removal, and cell cycle downregulation. All these functions highlight the importance of Ambra1 in crucial physiological events, including metabolism, cell death, and cell division. Importantly, Ambra1 is also crucial for proper embryonic development, and its complete absence in knock-out animal models leads to severe brain morphology defects. In line with this, it has recently been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders affecting humans, particularly autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Here, we discuss the recent links between Ambra1 and neurodevelopment, particularly focusing on its role during the maturation of hippocampal parvalbumin interneurons and its importance for maintaining a proper  excitation/inhibition balance in the brain.

We also showed that mitochondrial processes impact adult behavior. However, no experimental data is available to causally connect mode of delivery with cellular processes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and adult behavior. Here we show that surgical delivery of pups alters mitochondrial dynamics and spine synapses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex compared to the values of mice delivered vaginally. These alterations in ultrastructure seen in adult mice delivered surgically were associated with the development of behavioral phenotypes resembling those characteristic of animal models of psychiatric illness. This included impaired performance in prepulse inhibition as well as hyperlocomotion in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Knocking out a mitochondria-related gene, UCP-2, blocked cellular and behavioral adaptations induced by surgical delivery. These results highlight a crucial role for brain mitochondrial adaptations in the process of birth to affect neuronal circuitry in support of normal and altered adult behaviors. Further, these findings were supported with neuroimaging data from human neonates delivered vaginally and surgically, suggesting that the murine findings have human clinical relevance.

Here, we report the analysis of the first genetic model of CEDNIK in zebrafish. Strikingly, homozygous snap29 mutant larvae display CEDNIK-like features, such as microcephaly and skin defects. Consistent with Snap29 role in membrane fusion during autophagy, we observe accumulation of the autophagy markers p62 and LC3, and formation of aberrant multilamellar organelles and mitochondria. Importantly, we find high levels of apoptotic cell death during early development that might play a yet uncharacterized role in CEDNIK pathogenesis. Mutant larvae also display mouth opening problems, feeding impairment and swimming difficulties. These alterations correlate with defective trigeminal nerve formation and excess axonal branching.  Since the paralog Snap25 is known to promote axonal branching, Snap29 might act in opposition with, or modulate Snap25 activity during neurodevelopment. Our vertebrate genetic model of CEDNIK extends the description in vivo of the multisystem defects due to loss of Snap29 and could provide the base to test compounds that might ameliorate traits of the disease.

Mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics is crucial to maintain functional mitochondria, yet little is known about how fluoride perturbs this dynamics and whether such perturbation contributes to impaired neurodevelopment. Here in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with sodium fluoride (NaF, 20, 40 and 60 mg/L), mitochondrial fission suppression exerted a central role in NaF-induced mitochondrial abnormalities and the resulting autophagy deficiency, apoptosis augmentation, and compromised neuronal survival. Mechanically, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial fission exacerbated NaF-induced mitochondrial defects and cell death through promoting apoptosis despite partial autophagy restoration. Conversely, genetic enhancement of mitochondrial fission alleviated NaF-produced  detrimental mitochondrial and cellular outcomes by elevating autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. Further suppressing autophagy was harmful, while blocking apoptosis was beneficial for cellular survival in this context. Consistently, using Sprague-Dawley rats developmentally exposed to NaF (10, 50, and 100 mg/L) from pre-pregnancy until 2 months of delivery to mimic human exposure, we showed  that perinatal exposure to environmentally relevant levels of fluoride caused learning and memory impairments, accompanied by hippocampal mitochondrial morphological alterations manifested as fission suppression and fusion acceleration, along with defective autophagy, excessive apoptosis and neuronal loss. Intriguingly, the disturbed circulating levels of identified mitochondrial  fission/fusion molecules were closely associated with intellectual loss in children under long-term environmental drinking water fluoride exposure. Collectively, our results suggest that mitochondrial fission inhibition induces mitochondrial abnormalities, triggering abnormal autophagy and apoptosis, thus contributing to neuronal death, and that the mitochondrial dynamics molecules may act as promising indicators for developmental fluoride neurotoxicity.

Inherited mutations and accumulated damage to mitochondria over the course of ageing serve as key factors underlying cognitive defects in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, respectively. In this Review, we explore the recent findings that implicate mitochondria as crucial regulators of NSC function and cognition. In this respect, mitochondria may serve as targets for stem-cell-based therapies and interventions for cognitive defects.
DOI: 10.3390/cells7090140  PMCID: PMC6162757 PMID: 30227641 |Tracing Early Neurodevelopment in Schizophrenia with Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.|Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a devastating mental disorder that is characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotion, language, sense of self, and behavior. Epidemiological evidence suggests that subtle perturbations in early neurodevelopment increase later susceptibility for disease, which typically manifests in adolescence to early adulthood. Early perturbations are thought to be significantly mediated through incompletely understood genetic risk factors. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology allows for the in vitro analysis of disease-relevant neuronal cell types from the early stages of human brain development. Since iPSCs capture each donor's genotype, comparison between neuronal cells derived from healthy and diseased individuals can provide  important insights into the molecular and cellular basis of SCZ. In this review,  we discuss results from an increasing number of iPSC-based SCZ/control studies that highlight alterations in neuronal differentiation, maturation, and neurotransmission in addition to perturbed mitochondrial function and micro-RNA expression. In light of this remarkable progress, we consider also ongoing challenges from the field of iPSC-based disease modeling that call for further improvements on the generation and design of patient-specific iPSC studies to ultimately progress from basic studies on SCZ to tailored treatments.

We established a CS exposure rat model to determine how maternal CS exposure induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) essential to central chemoreceptive regulation of normal breathing. Pregnant rats were exposed to CS during gestational days 1-20, and the offspring were studied on postnatal day 2. Our data showed that maternal CS exposure resulted in elevated accumulation of ROS, which left a footprint on DNA and lipid with increases in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and malondialdehyde contents. Furthermore, maternal CS exposure induced decreases in manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase activities as well as reduction in  glutathione content in pFRG in the offspring. Moreover, maternal exposure to CS led to mitochondrial ultrastructure changes, mitochondrial swelling, reduction in ATP generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number. These findings suggest that maternal exposure to CS alters normal development of pFRG that is critical for normal respiratory control.

Given that mitochondrial trafficking, dynamics and remodeling have key roles in synaptic plasticity, we tested the role of Wdfy3 on brain bioenergetics by using Wdfy3+/lacZ mice, the only known Wdfy3 mutant animal model with overt neurodevelopmental anomalies that survive to adulthood. We found that Wdfy3 is required for sustaining brain bioenergetics and morphology via mitophagy. Decreased mitochondrial quality control by conventional mitophagy was partly compensated for by the increased formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDV) targeted to lysosomal degradation (micromitophagy). These observations, extended  through proteomic analysis of mitochondria-enriched cortical fractions, showed significant enrichment for pathways associated with mitophagy, mitochondrial transport and axon guidance via semaphorin, Robo, L1cam and Eph-ephrin signaling. Collectively, our findings support a critical role for Wdfy3 in mitochondrial homeostasis with implications for neuron differentiation, neurodevelopment and age-dependent neurodegeneration.

We recently reported that adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia (postnatal day [P] 2 to 14) had spatial navigation  memory deficits associated with hippocampal shrinkage. The mechanisms by which early oxidative stress impair neurodevelopment are not known. Our objective was to identify early hyperoxia-induced alterations in hippocampal receptors and signaling pathways necessary for memory formation. We evaluated C57BL/6 mouse pups at P14, exposed to either 85% oxygen or air from P2 to 14. We performed targeted analysis of hippocampal ligand-gated ion channels and proteins necessary for memory formation, and global bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed hippocampal genes and proteins. Hyperoxia decreased hippocampal mGLU7,  TrkB, AKT, ERK2, mTORC1, RPS6, and EIF4E and increased α3, α5, and ɤ2 subunits of GABAA receptor and PTEN proteins, although changes in gene expression were not always concordant. Bioinformatic analysis indicated dysfunction in mitochondria and global protein synthesis and translational processes. In conclusion, supraphysiological oxygen exposure reduced proteins necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory formation and may adversely impact hippocampal mitochondrial function and global protein synthesis. These early hippocampal changes may account for memory deficits seen in preterm survivors following prolonged oxygen supplementation.

Several lines of evidence suggest that maternal gut microbiota influences in utero fetal development via modulation of host's microbial composition with prebiotics. Hence we examined the hypothesis if inulin (IN) supplements during pregnancy in rats possess the potential to alleviate brain oxidative response and mitochondrial deficits employing a developmental model of rotenone (ROT) neurotoxicity. Initially, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged during gestational days (GDs) 6-19 with 0 (control), 10 (low), 30 (mid) or 50 (high) mg/kg bw/day of ROT to recapitulate developmental effects on general fetotoxicity (assessed by the number of fetuses, fetal body and placental weights), markers of oxidative stress and cholinergic activities in maternal brain regions and whole fetal-brain. Secondly, dams orally supplemented with inulin (2×/day, 2 g/kg/bw) on GD 0-21 were administered ROT (50 mg/kg, GD 6-19). IN supplements increased maternal cecal bacterial numbers that significantly corresponded with improved exploratory-related behavior among ROT administered rats. In addition, IN supplements improved fetal and placental weight on GD 19. IN diminished gestational ROT-induced increased reactive oxygen species levels, protein and lipid peroxidation biomarkers, and cholinesterase activity in maternal brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, and striatum) and fetal brain. Moreover, in the maternal cortex, mitochondrial assessment revealed IN protected against ROT-induced reduction in NADH cytochrome c oxidoreductase and ATPase activities.  These data suggest a potential role for indigestible oligosaccharides in reducing oxidative stress-mediated developmental origins of neurodegenerative disorders.

The evaluation and analysis showed that the components of MAM were highly conserved not only between different species (human and mouse) but also between different tissues (testes and brains). Bioinformatics interrogation of these MAM protein catalogues uncovered that 815 new potential linkages specifically existed in mouse testes compared with mouse brains. In addition, a comparative analysis showed that 1347 proteins (account for ≈96.56%) were highly conservatively expressed in both human and mouse testis  MAMs. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that testis-specific MAM proteins were related to spermatogenesis, male gamete generation, as well as sexual reproduction. The data identified, for the first time, numerous MAM proteins in mouse and human testes, which provide a possibility to define the relationship between testis MAM proteins and reproductive diseases.

This view is currently revisited, given emerging evidence of critical roles of IR-mediated signaling in  development, neuroprotection, metabolism, and plasticity in the brain. These diverse cellular and physiological IR activities are distinct from metabolic IR functions in peripheral tissues, thus highlighting region specificity of IR properties. This particularly concerns the fact that two IR isoforms, A and B, are predominantly expressed in either the brain or peripheral tissues, respectively, and neurons express exclusively IR-A. Intriguingly, in comparison with IR-B, IR-A displays high binding affinity and is also activated by low concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), a regulator of neuronal plasticity, whose dysregulation is associated with neuropathologic processes. Deficiencies in IR activation, insulin availability, and downstream IR-related mechanisms may result in aberrant IR-mediated functions and, subsequently, a broad range of brain disorders, including neurodevelopmental syndromes, neoplasms, neurodegenerative conditions, and depression. Here, we discuss findings on the brain-specific features of IR-mediated signaling with focus on mechanisms of primary receptor activation and their roles in the neuropathology.  We aimed to uncover the remaining gaps in current knowledge on IR physiology and  highlight new therapies targeting IR, such as IR sensitizers.

However, both HIV antiretroviral therapy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been associated with mitochondrial alterations. Leukocyte mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content can serve as a marker for mitochondrial dysfunction. In this cross-sectional, nested  case-control study, HEU children with ASD were matched approximately 1:3 on age,  sex, and ethnicity to HEU children without ASD, HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) controls, and HUU children with ASD. Leukocyte mtDNA content was measured using quantitative PCR. Among 299 HEU in this study, 14 (4.7%) were diagnosed with ASD, which is higher than the general population prevalence estimates. HEU children without ASD and HUU children with ASD had higher mtDNA content than HUU controls. HEU children with ASD had significantly higher mtDNA content than all other study groups. Our results suggest a clear association between elevated leukocyte mtDNA  content and both HEU and ASD status. This may implicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the high ASD prevalence observed in our cohort.

Recent research has uncovered an important role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), an energetic process essential for neurodevelopment that continues to support brain metabolism during adulthood. Thyroid hormone stimulation of FAO has been shown to be protective in astrocytes and mouse models of brain injury, yet a clear mechanism of this relationship has not been elucidated. Thyroid hormone interacts with multiple receptors located in the nucleus and the mitochondria, initiating rapid and long-term effects via both genomic and nongenomic pathways.  This has complicated efforts to isolate and study-specific interactions. This chapter presents the primary signaling pathways that have been identified to play a role in the thyroid hormone-mediated increase in FAO. Investigation of the impact of thyroid hormone on FAO in the adult brain has challenged classical models of brain metabolism and widened the window of potential neuroprotective strategies. A detailed understanding of these pathways is essential for any researchers aiming to expand the field of neuroenergetics.

The brain is dependent on glucose and other metabolites for proper function and is spared from metabolic deficits even during starvation. In this review, we outline how the nutrient-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic post-translational modification O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) regulates protein homeostasis. The O-GlcNAc modification is highly abundant in the mammalian brain and has been linked to proteopathies, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. C. elegans, Drosophila, and mouse models harboring O-GlcNAc transferase- and O-GlcNAcase-knockout alleles have helped define the role O-GlcNAc plays in development as well as age-associated neurodegenerative disease. These enzymes add and remove the single monosaccharide from protein serine and threonine residues, respectively. Blocking O-GlcNAc cycling is detrimental to mammalian brain development and interferes with neurogenesis, neural migration, and proteostasis. Findings in C. elegans and Drosophila model systems indicate that the dynamic turnover of O-GlcNAc is critical for maintaining levels of key transcriptional regulators responsible for neurodevelopment cell fate decisions. In addition, pathways of autophagy and  proteasomal degradation depend on a transcriptional network that is also reliant  on O-GlcNAc cycling. Like the quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum which uses a 'mannose timer' to monitor protein folding, we propose that cytoplasmic proteostasis relies on an 'O-GlcNAc timer' to help regulate the lifetime and fate of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. O-GlcNAc-dependent developmental alterations impact metabolism and growth of the developing mouse embryo and persist into adulthood. Brain-selective knockout mouse models will be  an important tool for understanding the role of O-GlcNAc in the physiology of the brain and its susceptibility to neurodegenerative injury.

Impaired autoregulation after hypoxia-ischaemia has been suggested to  contribute further to injury. Thalamic lactate/N-Acetylasperate (Lac/NAA) peak area ratio of > 0.3 on proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is associated with poor neurodevelopment outcome following HIE. Cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO) plays a central role in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and ATP synthesis. Using a novel broadband NIRS system, we investigated the impact of pressure passivity of cerebral metabolism (CCO), oxygenation (haemoglobin difference (HbD)) and cerebral blood volume (total haemoglobin (HbT)) in 23 term  infants following HIE during therapeutic hypothermia (HT). Sixty-minute epochs of data from each infant were studied using wavelet analysis at a mean age of 48 h.  Wavelet semblance (a measure of phase difference) was calculated to compare reactivity between mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) with oxCCO, HbD and HbT. OxCCO-MABP semblance correlated with thalamic Lac/NAA ( r = 0.48, p = 0.02). OxCCO-MABP semblance also differed between groups of infants with mild to moderate and severe injury measured using brain MRI score ( p = 0.04), thalamic Lac/NAA ( p = 0.04) and neurodevelopmental outcome at one year ( p = 0.04). Pressure passive changes in cerebral metabolism were associated with injury severity indicated by thalamic Lac/NAA, MRI scores and neurodevelopmental assessment at one year of age.

The importance of mitochondria within the brain has been long known, particularly given the high-energy demanding nature of neurons. The energy demands imposed by neurons require the well-orchestrated morphological adaptation and distribution of mitochondria. Recent studies now reveal the importance of mitochondrial dynamics not only in mature neurons but also during neural development, particularly during the process of neurogenesis and neural stem cell fate decisions. In this review, we will highlight the recent findings that illustrate the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in neurodevelopment and neural stem cell function.

Therefore, it is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments. However, the mechanism of its action on neurodevelopment is still to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that the cellular response of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to idebenone depends on  the stage of neural differentiation. When: neural stem cells (NSC), early neural  progenitors (eNP) and advanced neural progenitors (NP) have been studied a significant stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis was observed only at the eNP  stage of development. This coexists with the enhancement of cell viability and increase in total cell number. In addition, we report novel idebenone properties  in a possible regulation of neural stem cells fate decision: only eNP stage responded with up-regulation of both neuronal (MAP2), astrocytic (GFAP) markers,  while at NSC and NP stages significant down-regulation of MAP2 expression was observed, promoting astrocyte differentiation. Thus, idebenone targets specific stages of hiPSC differentiation and may influence the neural stem cell fate decision.

While the insecticidal actions and acute toxicity of CPF are attributed to its oxon metabolite (CPO) which potently inhibits the cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), there is significant evidence that CPF, CPO, and other organophosphates may affect a variety of neuronal targets and processes that are not directly related to AChE. Previously, in adult rat sciatic nerves ex vivo and postnatal neurons from rats in vitro we observed that CPF and CPO impaired the movements of vesicles and mitochondria in axons. Here, in embryonic  neurons from rats in culture, we evaluated 24h exposures to CPF and CPO across picomolar to micromolar concentrations for effects on fast axonal transport of membrane bound organelles (MBOs) that contained the amyloid precursor protein (APP) tagged with the fluorescent marker, Dendra2 (APPDendra2). The most notable  observations of this study were concentration-dependent decreases in the velocity and percentage of MBOs moving in the anterograde direction, an increase in the number of stationary MBOs, and an increased frequency of pauses associated with both CPF and CPO. These effects occurred at concentrations that did not significantly inhibit AChE activity, they were not blocked by cholinergic receptor antagonists, and they were not associated with compromised cell viability. These effects of CPF and CPO may be significant given the importance of axonal transport to neuronal development as well the function of fully developed neurons.

RTT affects predominantly females, and has a prevalence of roughly 1 in every 10,000 female births. Prior to the discovery that mutations of MECP2 are the leading cause of RTT, there were suggestions that RTT could be a mitochondrial disease. In fact, several reports documented altered mitochondrial structure, and deficiencies in mitochondrial enzyme activity in different cells or tissues derived from RTT patients. With the identification of MECP2 as the causal gene, interest largely shifted toward defining the normal function of MeCP2 in the brain, and how its absence affects the neurodevelopment and neurophysiology. Recently, though, interest in studying mitochondrial function in RTT has been reignited, at least in part due to observations suggesting systemic oxidative stress does play a contributing role in RTT pathogenesis. Here we review data relating to mitochondrial alterations at the structural and functional levels in RTT patients and model systems, and present a hypothesis for how the absence of MeCP2 could lead to altered mitochondrial function and elevated levels of cellular oxidative  stress. Finally, we discuss the prospects for treating RTT using interventions that target specific aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction and/or oxidative stress.

Neurological impairment may occur secondary to ketoacidotic episodes. However, we observed neuromotor abnormalities without ketoacidotic events in two T2-deficient families. We hypothesized that the neurological signs were related to the genetic defect and may occur independently of ketoacidotic episodes. We therefore conducted a retrospective review on a French T2-deficient patient series searching for neuromotor impairment. METHODS: In total, 26 cases were retrospectively analysed for clinical, biological and neuroimaging data. RESULTS: Neurological findings were observed for 6/26 (23%) patients. Among these, two had never experienced ketoacidotic episodes, though they developed extrapyramidal signs with putamen involvement. Two of the other four patients developed neurological abnormalities before the first ketoacidotic crisis, with putamen involvement in one case. The third patient developed extrapyramidal symptoms more than 10 years after the initial decompensation with globus pallidus involvement. The last patient developed extrapyramidal signs immediately after a  severe ketoacidotic crisis with putaminal lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Most T2-deficient patients achieved normal neurodevelopment. However, on account of the role of T2 in isoleucine catabolism, these patients are potentially exposed to accumulation of toxic isoleucine-derived metabolites,  which may contribute to neurological impairment. Our findings confirm previous observations that neurological symptoms in T2 deficiency may occur unrelated to ketoacidosis. The role of protein restriction as a preventive measure against neurological symptoms could not be established in this study and deserves further evaluation. Long-term follow-up data on children diagnosed by newborn screening may clarify the pathogenesis of this neurometabolic association.

Despite a considerable amount of studies, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying autism  remain obscure. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the development of autism. Vitamin D deficiency is emerging as a consistently reported risk factor in children. One reason for the prominence now being given to this risk factor is that it would appear to interact with several other epidemiological risk factors for autism. Vitamin D is an active neurosteroid and  plays crucial neuroprotective roles in the developing brain. It has important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, immunomodulation, regulation of  neurotransmission and steroidogenesis. Animal studies have suggested that transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with altered brain development. Here we review the potential neurobiological mechanisms linking prenatal vitamin D deficiency and autism and also discuss what future research targets must now be addressed.

The authors, therefore, evaluated whether changes in synaptic transmission after dendritic spine formation induced  by sevoflurane were associated with long-term behavioral changes. The effects of  sevoflurane on mitochondrial function were also assessed to further understand the mechanism behind spinogenesis. METHODS: Postnatal day 16 to 17 mice were exposed to sevoflurane (2.5% for 2 h),  and synaptic transmission was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex 6 h or 5 days later. The expression of postsynaptic proteins and mitochondrial function were measured after anesthesia. Long-term behavioral changes were assessed in adult mice. RESULTS: Sevoflurane increased the expression of excitatory postsynaptic proteins in male and female mice (n = 3 to 5 per group). Sevoflurane exposure in male mice transiently increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency (control: 8.53 ± 2.87; sevoflurane: 11.09 ± 2.58) but decreased miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency (control: 10.18 ± 4.66; sevoflurane: 6.88 ± 2.15). Unexpectedly, sevoflurane increased miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency (control: 1.81 ± 1.11; sevoflurane: 3.56 ± 1.74) in female mice (neurons, n = 10 to 21 per group). Sevoflurane also increased mitochondrial respiration in male mice (n = 5 to 8 per group). However, such changes from anesthesia during the critical period did not induce long-term behavioral consequences. Values are presented as mean ± SD. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane exposure during the critical period induces mitochondrial hyperactivity and transient imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmission, without long-lasting behavioral consequences. Further studies are needed to confirm sexual differences and to define the role of mitochondrial activity during anesthesia-induced spine formation.

Increasing studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial  effects of polyphenols on human health. Extensive reviews have discussed the protective effects of polyphenols against a series of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Limited studies have investigated the potential therapeutic effects of these natural compounds on neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disability, such as Down syndrome (DS), for which mitochondrial dysfunctions and  oxidative stress are hallmarks and contribute to the deleterious symptoms and cognitive decline. This review, starting from the structure, source, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of relevant polyphenols, highlights recent studies on the effect and potential molecular mechanism(s) of action of the phenolic compounds epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resveratrol and hydroxytyrosol in  restoring mitochondrial energy deficit and in reversing phenotypical alteration in DS. The clinical implications of plant polyphenol dietary supplements as therapeutic tools in managing DS and other intellectual disability-related diseases, is also discussed.

Here, we describe the derivation and characterization, including single-cell RNA-seq, of neocortical and spinal cord neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells to model early human neurodevelopment and ZIKV-related neuropathogenesis. By analyzing human NES cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and a ZIKV-infected micrencephalic brain,  we show that ZIKV infects both neocortical and spinal NES cells as well as their  fetal homolog, radial glial cells (RGCs), causing disrupted mitoses, supernumerary centrosomes, structural disorganization, and cell death. ZIKV infection of NES cells and RGCs causes centrosomal depletion and mitochondrial sequestration of phospho-TBK1 during mitosis. We also found that nucleoside analogs inhibit ZIKV replication in NES cells, protecting them from ZIKV-induced  pTBK1 relocalization and cell death. We established a model system of human neural stem cells to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZIKV infection and its potential treatment.

In siblings from two unrelated families who died soon after birth with a profound neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by pontocerebellar hypoplasia and apnoea, we discovered a missense mutation and an exonic deletion in the SLC25A46 gene encoding a mitochondrial protein recently implicated in optic atrophy spectrum disorder. We performed functional studies that confirmed the mitochondrial localization and pro-fission properties of SLC25A46. Knockdown of slc24a46 expression in zebrafish embryos caused brain malformation, spinal motor neuron loss, and poor motility. At the cellular level, we observed abnormally elongated mitochondria, which was rescued by co-injection  of the wild-type but not the mutant slc25a46 mRNA. Conversely, overexpression of  the wild-type protein led to mitochondrial fragmentation and disruption of the mitochondrial network. In contrast to mutations causing non-lethal optic atrophy, missense mutations causing lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia markedly  destabilize the protein. Indeed, the clinical severity appears inversely correlated with the relative stability of the mutant protein. This genotype-phenotype correlation underscores the importance of SLC25A46 and fine tuning of mitochondrial fission and fusion in pontocerebellar hypoplasia and central neurodevelopment in addition to optic and peripheral neuropathy across the life span.

Linked to numerous signaling pathways  and cellular functions, mitochondria, and OXPHOS in particular, are involved in neuronal development, connectivity, plasticity, and differentiation. Impairments  in a variety of mitochondrial functions have been described in different general  and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZ), a severe, chronic, debilitating illness that heavily affects the lives of patients and their families. This article reviews findings emphasizing the role of OXPHOS in the pathophysiology of SCZ. Evidence accumulated during the past few decades from imaging, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies points at OXPHOS deficit involvement in SCZ. Abnormalities have been reported in high-energy phosphates generated by the OXPHOS, in the activity of its complexes and gene expression, primarily of complex I (CoI). In addition, cellular signaling such as cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca(+2), neuronal development, connectivity, and plasticity have been linked to OXPHOS function and are reported to be impaired in SCZ. Finally, CoI has been shown as a site of interaction for both dopamine (DA)  and antipsychotic drugs, further substantiating its role in the pathology of SCZ. Understanding the role of mitochondria and the OXPHOS in particular may encourage new insights into the pathophysiology and etiology of this debilitating disorder.

One percent worldwide population suffers with autism and males suffer more than females. Microglia plays an important role in neurodevelopment, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The present study has been designed to investigate the role of minocycline in prenatal valproic acid induced autism in rats. Animals with prenatal valproic acid have reduced social interaction (three chamber social behaviour apparatus),  spontaneous alteration (Y-Maze), exploratory activity (Hole board test), intestinal motility, serotonin levels (both in prefrontal cortex and ileum) and prefrontal cortex mitochondrial complex activity (complexes I, II, IV). Furthermore, prenatal valproic acid treated animals have shown an increase in locomotion (actophotometer), anxiety (elevated plus maze), brain oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive species, glutathione, catalase), nitrosative stress (nitrite/nitrate), inflammation (both in brain and ileum myeloperoxidase activity), calcium and blood brain barrier permeability. Treatment with minocycline significantly attenuated prenatal valproic acid induced reduction in  social interaction, spontaneous alteration, exploratory activity intestinal motility, serotonin levels and prefrontal cortex mitochondrial complex activity.  Furthermore, minocycline has also attenuated prenatal valproic acid induced increase in locomotion, anxiety, brain oxidative and nitrosative stress, inflammation, calcium and blood brain barrier permeability. Thus, it may be concluded that prenatal valproic acid has induced autistic behaviour, biochemistry and blood brain barrier impairment in animals, which were significantly attenuated by minocycline. Minocycline should be explored further for its therapeutic benefits in autism.

Between the environmental determinants of the fetal  brain, maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy has been shown to negatively influence the infant temperament development. This in turn may have adverse consequences on the infant neurodevelopment extending throughout the entire life-span. However little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms of  the effects of maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy on infant temperament. Environmental stressors such as maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy activate the stress response cascade that in turn drives the increase in the cellular energy demand of vital organs with high metabolic rates such as, in pregnancy, the placenta. Key players of the stress response cascade are the mitochondria. RESULTS: Here, we tested the expression of all 13 protein-coding genes encoded by the mitochondria in 108 placenta samples from the Stress in Pregnancy birth cohort, a study that aims at determining the influence of in utero exposure to maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy on infant temperament. We showed that the expression of the protein-coding mitochondrial-encoded gene MT-ND2 was positively associated with indices of maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy including Prenatal Perceived Stress (β = 0.259; p-regression = 0.004; r2-regression = 0.120), State Anxiety (β = 0.218; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.153), Trait Anxiety (β = 0.262; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.129) and Pregnancy Anxiety Total (β = 0.208; p-regression = 0.010; r2-regression = 0.103). In the meantime MT-ND2 was negatively associated with the infant temperament indices of Activity Level (β = -0.257; p-regression = 0.008; r2-regression = 0.165) and Smile and Laughter (β = -0.286; p-regression =  0.036; r2-regression = 0.082). Additionally, MT-ND6 was associated with the maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy index of Prenatal Perceived Stress (β = -0.231; p-regression = 0.004; r2-regression = 0.120), while MT-CO2 was associated with the maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy indices of State Anxiety (β =  0.206; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.153) and Trait Anxiety (β = 0.205; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.129). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the role of mitochondria in responding to maternal  psychosocial stress in pregnancy, as assessed in placenta, while also suggesting  an important role for the mitochondria in the infant temperament development.

Apaf1 involvement in orchestrating this process during embryonic development has  been widely documented and constitutes a breakthrough in developmental biology. In this review, we aim to highlight the origin of Apaf1 discoveries and how findings, mainly based on the analysis of knock-out mouse models, have led us to  consider Apaf1 as a master player in fine-tuning apoptosis during embryonic development. Likewise, we also attempt to establish how Apaf1 function is locally time-dependent in regulating neurodevelopment and becomes dispensable during neuron maturation. We go on to discuss Apaf1's new functions which have been unveiled in recent years and which could revise or, at least, adjust the common view of Apaf1 having merely an apoptotic role. Hence, by presenting clear indications on the pro-survival roles of Apaf1, this review seeks to provide novel and more complex insights into Apaf1 involvement in nervous system development.

Cells can respond to environmental  stressors in many ways: inducing oxidative stress/inflammation, changes in energy production and epigenetic alterations. Mitochondria, tiny organelles that each retains their own DNA, are exquisitely sensitive to environmental insults and are thought to be central players in these pathways. While it is intuitive that mitochondria play an important role in disease processes, given that every cell of our body is dependent on energy metabolism, it is less clear how environmental exposures impact mitochondrial mechanisms that may lead to enhanced risk of disease. Many of the effects of the environment are initiated in utero and integrating mitochondriomics into children's environmental health studies is a critical priority. This review will highlight (i) the importance of exploring environmental mitochondriomics in children's environmental health, (ii) why environmental mitochondriomics is well suited to biomarker development in this context, and (iii) how molecular and epigenetic changes in mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may reflect exposures linked to childhood health outcomes.

The disease is characterized by a period of 6 to 18 months of apparently normal neurodevelopment, followed by early neurological regression, with a progressive loss of acquired cognitive, social, and motor skills. RTT is known to be caused in 95% of the cases by sporadic de novo loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein able to regulate gene expression. Despite almost two decades of research into the functions and role of MeCP2, little is known about the mechanisms leading from MECP2 mutation to the disease. Oxidative stress (OS) is involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, although in many cases it is not clear whether OS is a cause or a consequence of the pathology. Fairly recently, the presence of a systemic OS has  been demonstrated in RTT patients with a strong correlation with the patients' clinical status. The link between MECP2 mutation and the redox imbalance found in RTT is not clear. Animal studies have suggested a possible direct correlation between Mecp2 mutation and increased OS levels. In addition, the restoration of Mecp2 function in astrocytes significantly improves the developmental outcome of  Mecp2-null mice and reexpression of Mecp2 gene in the brain of null mice restored oxidative damage, suggesting that Mecp2 loss of function can be involved in oxidative brain damage. Starting from the evidence that oxidative damage in the brain of Mecp2-null mice precedes the onset of symptoms, we evaluated whether, based on the current literature, the dysfunctions described in RTT could be a consequence or, in contrast, could be caused by OS. We also analyzed whether therapies that at least partially treated some RTT symptoms can play a role in defense against OS. At this stage we can propose that OS could be one of the main causes of the dysfunctions observed in RTT. In addition, the major part of the therapies recommended to alleviate RTT symptoms have been shown to interfere with oxidative homeostasis, suggesting that MeCP2 could somehow be involved in the protection of the brain from OS.

Here, we report that Mn ion at high concentrations can be delivered to pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to enhance cellular neurodevelopment without toxicity. Mn(2+) release from AuNPs was designed to be pH-responsive so that low pH condition of the cell endosomes can trigger in situ release of Mn(2+) from AuNPs after cellular uptake of Mn-incorporated AuNPs (MnAuNPs). Due to the differences in reduction potentials of Mn and Au, only Mn ionized and released while Au remained intact when MnAuNPs  were uptaken by cells. Compared to PC12 cells treated with a high concentration of free Mn(2+), PC12 cells treated with an equal concentration of MnAuNPs resulted in significantly enhanced cellular neurodevelopment with decreased apoptosis and necrosis. Treatment with a high concentration of free Mn(2+) led to an abrupt consumption of a large amount of ATP for the intracellular transport of Mn(2+) through the ion channel of the cell membrane and to mitochondrial damage caused by the high intracellular concentration of Mn(2+), both of which resulted  in cell necrosis and apoptosis. In contrast, MnAuNP-treated cells consumed much smaller amount of ATP for the intracellular transport of MnAuNPs by endocytosis and showed pH-triggered in situ release of Mn(2+) from the MnAuNPs in the endosomes of the cells, both of which prevented the cell death caused by ATP depletion and mitochondrial damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of AuNPs as a vehicle for pH-responsive, intracellular delivery of metal  ion, which may open a new window for drug delivery and clinical therapy.
The aim of the study was to detect the role of lactate acidosis, also to find the share of mitochondrial insufficiency in development of various neurologic syndromes in children and adolescents. The detection of cellular energetic metabolism and acid based imbalance is also important for finding the specific method of management. We have studied 200 patients with various degree of neurodevelopment delay with epilepsy and epileptic syndromes, headache, vertigo,  early strokes, floppy infant syndrome, atrophy of ophthalmic nerve, cataracta, neurosensory deafness, systemic myopathy, cerebral palsy. In 27% of cases with various ages we have detected lactate acidosis and increase level of pyruvate. Mitochondrial insufficiency was seen in 8% of cases which gives us opportunity to find the specific method of treatment in this group of patients. Each patient with neurological symptoms requires correction of parameters of energetic and oxidative metabolism.|[The role of lactate acidosis in the development and treatment of various neurologic syndromes in children and adolescents].|Arveladze GA, Geladze NM, Sanikidze TB, Khachapuridze NS, Bakhtadze SZ.

In order to better understand cellular responses in brain tissues disrupted by prenatal transfer of MCs, this work mainly focuses on brain impairments of rat offspring. Pregnant SD rats were infused exposed to microcystin-LR (MCLR) at 10μg/kg body weight (BW)/day or saline solution from gestational day 8 (GD8) to postnatal day 15 (PD15) of lactation. MCLR accumulation, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity were detected. The results showed that MCLR enhanced toxin accumulation and MDA, but decreased GSH and the level of AChE activity in the brains of rat offspring. MCLR also caused changes to cerebrum ultrastructure, showing a sparse structure, distention of endoplasmic reticulum and swelling mitochondria. To explore the exact mechanisms, we used a proteomic analysis to identify global brain protein profiles. The proteomic results revealed that MCLR  remarkably altered the abundance of 49 proteins that were involved in neurodevelopment, oxidative phosphorylation, cytoskeleton, metabolism, protein folding and degradation. Our results indicated that MCLR exerts neurotoxicity mainly by generating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The integration of proteomics and bioinformatics analyses revealed  that perinatal exposure to MCLR can occur from mother to offspring and impair the brain of rat pups. MCLR has negative effects on the development of nervous system mainly by generating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Mitochondria are also essential to many aspects of neurodevelopment and neuronal  functions. However, mitochondrial impairment may affect bioenergetics in the developing brain and alter critical neuronal processes leading to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe neuropsychiatric disorder of neurodevelopmental origin. Immuno-inflammatory pathway is one of the widely appreciated mechanisms that has consistently been implicated in the neurodevelopmental origin of schizophrenia. However, the source of inflammation and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms leading to schizophrenia are yet to be fully ascertained. Recent understanding reveals that  perturbation of mitochondrial network dynamics might lead to various nervous system disorders with inflammatory pathologies. Mitochondrial deficit, altered redox balance and chronic low-grade inflammation are evident in schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that oxidative/nitrosative stress responses due to mitochondrial  dysfunctions might activate immuno-inflammatory pathways and subsequently lead to neuroprogressive changes in schizophrenia. Herein, we summarise the current understanding of molecular links between mitochondrial dysfunctions and pathogenesis of schizophrenia based on evidence from genomics, proteomics and imaging studies, which together support a role for mitochondrial impairment in the pathogenetic pathways of schizophrenia.

We previously identified O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) as a placental biomarker in our mouse model of early prenatal stress (EPS), where OGT levels were lower in male compared with female tissue and were further decreased following maternal stress. However, the function of placental OGT in programming the developing brain has not been determined. Therefore, we generated a transgenic mouse with targeted placental disruption of  Ogt (Pl-OGT) and examined offspring for recapitulation of the adult EPS phenotype. Pl-OGT hemizygous and EPS male placentas showed similar robust changes in gene expression patterns suggestive of an altered ability to respond to endocrine and inflammatory signals, supporting placental OGT as an important mediator of EPS effects. ChIP-Seq for the O-GlcNAc mark identified the 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 (Hsd17b3) locus in male EPS placentas, which correlated with a reduction in Hsd17b3 expression and concordant reduced testosterone conversion. Remarkably, Pl-OGT adult offspring had reduced body weights and elevated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis responsivity, recapitulating phenotypes previously reported for EPS males. Further, hypothalamic microarray gene-set enrichment analyses identified reduced mitochondrial function in both Pl-OGT and EPS males. Cytochrome c oxidase activity assays verified this finding, linking reduced placental OGT with critical brain programming. Together, these studies confirm OGT as in important placental biomarker of maternal stress and demonstrate the profound impact a single placental gene has on long-term metabolic and neurodevelopmental programming that may be related to an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.

Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are the major target tissue structures. This neuropathy is caused by mutations in the FXN gene  that encodes frataxin. Here, we investigated the mitochondrial and cell consequences of frataxin depletion in a cellular model based on frataxin silencing in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, a cell line that has been used widely as in vitro models for studies on neurological diseases. We showed that the reduction of frataxin induced mitochondrial dysfunction due to a bioenergetic deficit and abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis in the mitochondria that were associated  with oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses. The depletion of frataxin did  not cause cell death but increased autophagy, which may have a cytoprotective effect against cellular insults such as oxidative stress. Frataxin silencing provoked slow cell growth associated with cellular senescence, as demonstrated by increased SA-βgal activity and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. We postulate that cellular senescence might be related to a hypoplastic defect in the DRG during neurodevelopment, as suggested by necropsy studies.
DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M114.555573  PMCID: PMC4140906 PMID: 24733394  [Indexed for MEDLINE]|Mitochondrial MTHFD2L is a dual redox cofactor-specific methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase expressed in both adult and embryonic tissues.|Mammalian mitochondria are able to produce formate from one-carbon donors such as serine, glycine, and sarcosine. This pathway relies on the mitochondrial pool of  tetrahydrofolate (THF) and several folate-interconverting enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix. We recently identified MTHFD2L as the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) in adult mammalian mitochondria. We show here that the MTHFD2L enzyme is bifunctional, possessing both CH2-THF dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase activities. The dehydrogenase activity can use either NAD(+) or NADP(+) but requires both phosphate and Mg(2+) when using NAD(+). The NADP(+)-dependent dehydrogenase activity is inhibited by inorganic phosphate. MTHFD2L uses the mono- and polyglutamylated forms of CH2-THF with similar catalytic efficiencies. Expression of the MTHFD2L transcript is low in early mouse embryos but begins to increase at embryonic day 10.5 and remains elevated through birth. In adults, MTHFD2L is expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels observed in brain and  lung.

Although many studies have addressed the neurotoxicity induced by CPF, most data on neurodevelopmental damage was obtained from animal models. We are the first group to use human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a developing neuron model to evaluate the mechanisms involved in CPF-induced neurotoxicity. CPF was cytotoxic to these cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown by decreased cell viability and increased lactate dehydrogenase  release. Furthermore, CPF reduced the expression of AKT and ERK proteins which are involved in intracellular survival pathways. Exposure of hNPCs to CPF led to  the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the antioxidant N-acetyl-cystein (NAC) attenuated ROS production induced by CPF. In addition, CPF increased cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activated caspase-9 and -3, indicating that cell death induced by CPF was due to apoptosis in hNPCs. Consistent with these findings, CPF treatment reduced the level of Bcl-2 protein  and increased the level of Bax protein. Especially, CPF increased the translocation of BAX into the mitochondria. CPF also induced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB and p53 proteins in a concentration-dependent manner, and their inhibitors attenuated CPF-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, an inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear translocation blocked the increase of p53 in CPF-treated hNPCs. These findings show that CPF induced hNPCs death in part through NF-κB activation via ROS generation, enabling the interaction of p53 with Bcl-2 and Bax and subsequent release of cytochrome c. Collectively, these results represent a unique molecular characterization of CPF-induced cytotoxicity in hNPCs. These data suggest that CPF may affect neurodevelopment in a manner similar to that of  several known and suspected neurotoxicants.
DOI: 10.1016/j.neuint.2014.02.007  PMID: 24607700  [Indexed for MEDLINE]|Revisiting the neuropathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome.|Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a neonatal-lethal genetic disease that affects all tissues, and features neuropathology that involves primary developmental defects  as well as neurodegeneration. Neuropathological changes include abnormal neuronal migration affecting the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and inferior olivary complex, abnormal Purkinje cell arborisation, demyelination and post-developmental neuronal degeneration. ZS is caused by mutations in peroxisome biogenesis, or PEX, genes which lead to defective peroxisome biogenesis and the resultant loss of peroxisomal metabolic function. The molecular and cellular bases of ZS neuropathology are still not completely understood. Attempts to explain the neuropathogenesis have implicated peroxisomal metabolic dysfunction,  and more specifically the loss of peroxisomal products, such as plasmalogens and  docosahexaenoic, and the accumulation of peroxisomal substrates, such as very-long-chain-fatty acids. In this review, consideration is also given to recent findings that implicate other candidate pathogenetic factors, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, aberrant cell signalling, and inflammation - factors that have also been identified as important in the pathogenesis of other neurological diseases.
|RISC in PD: the impact of microRNAs in Parkinson's disease cellular and molecular pathogenesis.|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized primarily by the selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Although several genetic forms of PD have been identified, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying DA  neuron loss in PD remain elusive. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as potent post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression with fundamental roles in numerous biological processes. Although their role in PD pathogenesis is still a very active area of investigation, several seminal studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the roles these small non-coding RNAs play in the disease process. Among these are studies which  have demonstrated specific miRNAs that target and down-regulate the expression of PD-related genes as well as those demonstrating a reciprocal relationship in which PD-related genes act to regulate miRNA processing machinery. Concurrently,  a wealth of knowledge has become available regarding the molecular mechanisms that unify the underlying etiology of genetic and sporadic PD pathogenesis, including dysregulated protein quality control by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathway, activation of programmed cell death, mitochondrial damage  and aberrant DA neurodevelopment and maintenance. Following a discussion of the interactions between PD-related genes and miRNAs, this review highlights those studies which have elucidated the roles of these pathways in PD pathogenesis. We  highlight the potential of miRNAs to serve a critical regulatory role in the implicated disease pathways, given their capacity to modulate the expression of entire families of related genes. Although few studies have directly linked miRNA regulation of these pathways to PD, a strong foundation for investigation has been laid and this area holds promise to reveal novel therapeutic targets for PD.

Explanatory models support a potential role for neurotransmitter systems, inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotrophins and neurogenesis, and epigenetic effects, in anxiety pathogenesis. All of these pathways are affected by exposure to cigarette smoke components, including nicotine and free radicals. This review critically examines and summarizes the literature exploring the role of these systems in increased anxiety and how exposure to cigarette smoke may contribute to this pathology at a biological level. Further, this review explores the effects of cigarette smoke on normal neurodevelopment and anxiety control, suggesting how exposure in early life (prenatal, infancy, and adolescence) may predispose to higher anxiety in later life. A large heterogenous literature was reviewed that detailed the association  between cigarette smoking and anxiety symptoms and disorders with structural brain changes, inflammation, and cell-mediated immune markers, markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter systems, neurotrophins and neurogenesis. Some preliminary data were found for potential epigenetic effects. The literature provides some support for a potential interaction between cigarette smoking, anxiety symptoms and disorders,  and the above pathways; however, limitations exist particularly in delineating causative effects. The literature also provides insight into potential effects of cigarette smoke, in particular nicotine, on neurodevelopment. The potential treatment implications of these findings are discussed in regards to future therapeutic targets for anxiety. The aforementioned pathways may help mediate increased anxiety seen in people who smoke. Further research into the specific actions of nicotine and other cigarette components on these pathways, and how these pathways interact, may provide insights that lead to new treatment for anxiety and a greater understanding of anxiety pathogenesis.

Accumulating evidence suggests mitochondria as an additional pathological factor  in schizophrenia. An attractive model to study processes related to neurodevelopment in schizophrenia is reprogramming of somatic cells into induced  pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiating them into different neuronal lineages. iPSCs from three schizophrenia patients and from two controls were reprogrammed from hair follicle keratinocytes, because of their accessibility and common ectodermal origin with neurons. iPSCs were differentiated into Pax6(+)/Nestin(+) neural precursors and then further differentiated into β3-Tubulin(+)/tyrosine hydroxylase(+)/DAT(+) dopaminergic neurons. In addition, iPSCs were differentiated through embryonic bodies into β3-Tubulin(+)/Tbox brain1(+) glutamatergic neurons. Schizophrenia-derived dopaminergic cells showed  severely impaired ability to differentiate, whereas glutamatergic cells were unable to maturate. Mitochondrial respiration and its sensitivity to dopamine-induced inhibition were impaired in schizophrenia-derived keratinocytes  and iPSCs. Moreover, we observed dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential  (Δψm) and perturbations in mitochondrial network structure and connectivity in dopaminergic along the differentiation process and in glutamatergic cells. Our data unravel perturbations in neural differentiation and mitochondrial function,  which may be interconnected, and of relevance to dysfunctional neurodevelopmental processes in schizophrenia.
DOI: 10.1186/2040-2392-4-16  PMCID: PMC3680090 PMID: 23731516 |Decreased tryptophan metabolism in patients with autism spectrum disorders.|BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are relatively common neurodevelopmental conditions whose biological basis has been incompletely determined. Several biochemical markers have been associated with ASDs, but there is still no laboratory test for these conditions. METHODS: We analyzed the metabolic profile of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 137  patients with neurodevelopmental disorders with or without ASDs and 78 normal individuals, using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays. RESULTS: Metabolic profiling of lymphoblastoid cells revealed that the 87 patients with ASD as a clinical feature, as compared to the 78 controls, exhibited on average reduced generation of NADH when tryptophan was the sole energy source. The results correlated with the behavioral traits associated with  either syndromal or non-syndromal autism, independent of the genetic background of the individual. The low level of NADH generation in the presence of tryptophan was not observed in cell lines from non-ASD patients with intellectual disability, schizophrenia or conditions exhibiting several similarities with syndromal autism except for the behavioral traits. Analysis of a previous small gene expression study found abnormal levels for some genes involved in tryptophan metabolic pathways in 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tryptophan is a precursor of important compounds, such as serotonin, quinolinic acid, and kynurenic acid, which are involved in neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. In addition, quinolinic acid is the structural precursor of NAD+, a critical energy carrier in mitochondria. Also, the serotonin branch of the tryptophan metabolic pathway generates NADH. Lastly, the levels of quinolinic and kynurenic acid are strongly influenced by the activity of the immune system. Therefore, decreased tryptophan metabolism may alter brain development, neuroimmune activity and mitochondrial function. Our finding of decreased tryptophan metabolism appears to provide a unifying biochemical basis for ASDs and perhaps an initial step in the development of a diagnostic assay for ASDs.
DOI: 10.1186/2040-2392-3-12  PMCID: PMC3528421 PMID: 23116158 |Brain region-specific altered expression and association of mitochondria-related  genes in autism.|BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction (MtD) has been observed in approximately five percent of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). MtD could impair highly energy-dependent processes such as neurodevelopment, thereby contributing  to autism. Most of the previous studies of MtD in autism have been restricted to  the biomarkers of energy metabolism, while most of the genetic studies have been  based on mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Despite the mtDNA, most of the proteins essential for mitochondrial replication and function are encoded by  the genomic DNA; so far, there have been very few studies of those genes. Therefore, we carried out a detailed study involving gene expression and genetic  association studies of genes related to diverse mitochondrial functions. METHODS: For gene expression analysis, postmortem brain tissues (anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), motor cortex (MC) and thalamus (THL)) from autism patients (n=8) and controls (n=10) were obtained from the Autism Tissue Program (Princeton, NJ, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR arrays were used to quantify the expression of 84 genes related to diverse functions of mitochondria, including biogenesis, transport, translocation and apoptosis. We used the delta delta Ct (∆∆Ct) method for quantification of gene expression. DNA samples from 841 Caucasian and 188 Japanese families were used in the association study of genes selected from the gene expression analysis. FBAT was used to examine genetic association with autism. RESULTS: Several genes showed brain region-specific expression alterations in autism patients compared to controls. Metaxin 2 (MTX2), neurofilament, light polypeptide (NEFL) and solute carrier family 25, member 27 (SLC25A27) showed consistently reduced expression in the ACG, MC and THL of autism patients. NEFL (P = 0.038; Z-score 2.066) and SLC25A27 (P = 0.046; Z-score 1.990) showed genetic association with autism in Caucasian and Japanese samples, respectively. The expression of DNAJC19, DNM1L, LRPPRC, SLC25A12, SLC25A14, SLC25A24 and TOMM20 were reduced in at least two of the brain regions of autism patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, though preliminary, brings to light some new genes associated with MtD in autism. If MtD is detected in early stages, treatment strategies aimed at reducing its impact may be adopted.

Retinoid-associated signaling which plays an  essential role in neurodevelopment appears to remain active in the adult central  nervous system (CNS), thus assuming a high significance in the context of neurodegeneration, and indeed retinoid analogs are thought to be promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The ability  of retinoids to exert antioxidant effects, inhibit amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits and likely Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ-induced IL6 production and neuroinflammation, increase survival in hippocampal neurons, and reverse cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed. Although retinoids with their multi-target activity are revealing to be promising for management of AD which is a multifaceted biochemical phenomenon, timing as well as appropriate dosage and safety remain, however, a challenge. The end-stage lesions, namely senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are, at present, considered an adaptive response to oxidative stress underlying AD, thus  paradoxically late administration of retinoids could even suppress a protective mechanism by inhibiting Aβ deposits.

Quantitative real-time PCR arrays were used to quantify gene expression. We observed reduced expression of several ETC genes in autism brains compared to controls. Eleven genes of Complex I, five genes each of Complex III and Complex IV, and seven genes of Complex V showed brain region-specific reduced expression in autism. ATP5A1 (Complex V), ATP5G3 (Complex V) and NDUFA5 (Complex I) showed consistently reduced expression in all the brain regions of autism patients. Upon silencing ATP5A1, the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13), a p38 MAPK responsive to stress stimuli, was upregulated in HEK 293 cells. This could have been induced by oxidative stress due to impaired ATP synthesis. We report new candidate genes involved in abnormal brain bioenergetics in autism, supporting the hypothesis that mitochondria, critical for neurodevelopment, may play a role in autism.

However, direct biological effects and underlying neurochemical mechanisms remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify and evaluate underlying neurochemical change in the rat cerebellum with ETS exposure during critical period development. METHODS: We exposed rats to daily ETS (300, 100, and 0 µg/m3 total suspended particulate) from postnatal day 8 (PD8) to PD23 and then assayed the response at  the behavioral, neuroproteomic, and cellular levels. RESULTS: Postnatal ETS exposure induced heightened locomotor response in a novel  environment on par initially with amphetamine stimulation. The cerebellar mitochondrial subproteome was significantly perturbed in the ETS-exposed rats. Findings revealed a dose-dependent up-regulation of aerobic processes through the modification and increased translocation of Hk1 to the mitochondrion with corresponding heightened ATP synthase expression. ETS exposure also induced a dose-dependent increase in total Dnm1l mitochondrial fission factor; although more active membrane-bound Dnm1l was found at the lower dose. Dnm1l activation was associated with greater mitochondrial staining, particularly in the molecular layer, which was independent of stress-induced Bcl-2 family dynamics. Further, electron microscopy associated Dnm1l-mediated mitochondrial fission with increased biogenesis, rather than fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: The critical postnatal period of cerebellar development is vulnerable to the effects of ETS exposure, resulting in altered behavior. The biological effect of ETS is underlain in part by a Dnm1l-mediated mitochondrial energetic response at a time of normally tight control. These findings represent  a novel mechanism by which environmental exposure can impact neurodevelopment and function.
DOI: 10.1002/brb3.73  PMCID: PMC3432965 PMID: 22950046 |A novel Drosophila SOD2 mutant demonstrates a role for mitochondrial ROS in neurodevelopment and disease.|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in cell signaling, survival, and homeostasis. Aberrant ROS lead to disease and contribute to the aging process. Numerous enzymes and vigilant antioxidant pathways are required to regulate ROS for normal cellular health. Mitochondria are a major source of ROS,  and mechanisms to prevent elevated ROS during oxidative phosphorylation require super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity. SOD2, also known as MnSOD, is targeted to mitochondria and is instrumental in regulating ROS by conversion of superoxides to hydrogen peroxide, which is further broken down into H(2)O and oxygen. Here, we describe the identification of a novel mutation within the mitochondrial SOD2  enzyme in Drosophila that results in adults with an extremely shortened life span, sensitivity to hyperoxia, and neuropathology. Additional studies demonstrate that this novel mutant, SOD2(bewildered), exhibits abnormal brain morphology, suggesting a critical role for this protein in neurodevelopment. We investigated the basis of this neurodevelopmental defect and discovered an increase in aberrant axonal that could underlie the aberrant neurodevelopment and brain morphology defects. This novel allele, SOD2(bewildered), provides a unique  opportunity to study the effects of increased mitochondrial ROS on neural development, axonal targeting, and neural cell degeneration in vivo.

Accordingly, we have assessed how proteasome dysfunction during early postnatal development, induced by administering proteasome inhibitors daily during the first 10 days of life, affects the behaviour of adult mice. We found that this regime of exposure to the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin did not produce significant behavioural or morphological changes in the first 15 days of  life. However, towards the end of the treatment with proteasome inhibitors, there was a loss of mitochondrial markers and activity, and an increase in DNA oxidation. On reaching adulthood, the memory of mice that were injected with proteasome inhibitors postnatally was impaired in hippocampal and amygdala-dependent tasks, and they suffered motor dysfunction and imbalance. These behavioural deficiencies were correlated with neuronal loss in the hippocampus, amygdala and brainstem, and with diminished adult neurogenesis. Accordingly, impairing proteasome activity at early postnatal ages appears to cause morphological and behavioural alterations in adult mice that resemble those associated with certain neurodegenerative diseases and/or syndromes of mental retardation.

No studies have evaluated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities in a well-defined population of children with autism. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mitochondrial defects in children with autism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Observational study using data collected from patients aged 2 to 5 years who were a subset of children participating in the Childhood Autism Risk From Genes and Environment study in California, which is a  population-based, case-control investigation with confirmed autism cases and age-matched, genetically unrelated, typically developing controls, that was launched in 2003 and is still ongoing. Mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA abnormalities were evaluated in lymphocytes from 10 children with autism and 10 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oxidative phosphorylation capacity, mtDNA copy number and  deletions, mitochondrial rate of hydrogen peroxide production, and plasma lactate and pyruvate. RESULTS: The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase activity (normalized to citrate synthase activity) in lymphocytic mitochondria from children with autism was significantly lower compared with controls (mean, 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.8-6.0] vs 12 [95% CI, 8-16], respectively; P = .001). The majority of children with autism (6 of 10) had complex I activity below control range values. Higher plasma pyruvate levels were found in children  with autism compared with controls (0.23 mM [95% CI, 0.15-0.31 mM] vs 0.08 mM [95% CI, 0.04-0.12 mM], respectively; P = .02). Eight of 10 cases had higher pyruvate levels but only 2 cases had higher lactate levels compared with controls. These results were consistent with the lower pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed in children with autism compared with controls (1.0 [95% CI, 0.6-1.4] nmol × [min × mg protein](-1) vs 2.3 [95% CI, 1.7-2.9] nmol × [min × mg  protein](-1), respectively; P = .01). Children with autism had higher mitochondrial rates of hydrogen peroxide production compared with controls (0.34  [95% CI, 0.26-0.42] nmol × [min × mg of protein](-1) vs 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12-0.20]  nmol × [min × mg protein](-1) by complex III; P = .02). Mitochondrial DNA overreplication was found in 5 cases (mean ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA: 239 [95% CI, 217-239] vs 179 [95% CI, 165-193] in controls; P = 10(-4)). Deletions at the segment of cytochrome b were observed in 2 cases (ratio of cytochrome b to ND1: 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68-0.92] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93-1.05] for controls; P = .01). CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, children with autism were more likely to have mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA overreplication, and mtDNA deletions than typically developing children.

This mini-review will provide the reader with recent findings related to the proapoptotic actions of orexins and the entirely novel mechanism whereby the seven membrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) OX1R triggers apoptosis. Recent data show that orexins induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the tyrosine-based motifs - immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif - in OX1R. These  phosphorylations result in the recruitment and activation of the phosphotyrosine  phosphatase SHP-2 and subsequent cytochrome c-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Finally, this mini-review will also speculate on: (1) the potential importance of tyrosine-based motifs in the large family of GPCRs; (2) the interest of orexin receptors as therapeutic targets in cancer therapy; (3) the possible role of orexin receptor-mediated apoptosis in physiology and pathophysiology in the brain (neurodevelopment, neurodegenerative diseases) and in the periphery.

Accumulating genetic evidence supports that DISC1 is associated with  some aspects of cognitive functions relevant to SZ and BP. Here, we provide a summary of the current updates in biological studies of DISC1. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1, preferentially expressed in the forebrain, has multiple isoforms with potential posttranslational modifications. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 protein occurs in multiple subcellular compartments, which include the centrosome, microtubule fractions, postsynaptic densities, actin cytoskeletal fractions, the mitochondria, and the nucleus. Recent studies have clarified that DISC1 mediates at least centrosome-dynein cascade and cyclic  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Furthermore, both cytogenetic and cell  biological studies consistently suggest that an overall loss of DISC1 function (either haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative, or both) may be associated with  SZ and BP. On the basis of these findings, production of DISC1 genetically engineered mice is proposed as a promising animal model for SZ and BP. Several groups are currently generating DISC1 mice and starting to characterize them. In  this review, the advantages and disadvantages of each animal model are discussed.

During neural development in mammals, many progenitor cells, immature cells or differentiated cells undergo the most clearly characterized type of cell death, apoptosis. Several pathways of apoptosis have been linked to neural development, but according to the numerous and striking phenotypes observed when apoptotic genes are inactivated, the mitochondrial death-route is the most important pathway in this context. Here, we discuss the relative importance of pro-growth/pro-death factors in the control of neural tissue development. We also discuss the impact of studying programmed cell death  in development in order to better understand the basis of several human diseases  and embryonic defects of the nervous system.

Brain mitochondria that were isolated from 8-day, 17-day, and adult rats displayed decreasing levels of mitochondrial Bax. The amount of cytochrome c released from  brain mitochondria by a peptide containing the BH3 cell death domain decreased with increasing age. However, approximately 60% of cytochrome c in adult brain mitochondria could be released by the BH3 peptide in the presence of exogenous human recombinant Bax. Mitochondrial Bax was downregulated in PC12S neural cells  differentiated with nerve growth factor, and mitochondria isolated from these cells demonstrated decreased sensitivity to BH3-peptide-induced cytochrome c release. These results demonstrate that immature brain mitochondria and mitochondria from undifferentiated neural cells are particularly sensitive to cytochrome c release mediated by endogenous Bax and a BH3 death domain peptide. Postnatal developmental changes in mitochondrial Bax levels may contribute to the increased susceptibility of neurons to pathological apoptosis in immature animals.
|ortho-substituted PCB95 alters intracellular calcium signaling and causes cellular acidification in PC12 cells by an immunophilin-dependent mechanism.|ortho-Substituted PCBs mobilize Ca2+ from isolated brain microsomes by interaction with FKBP12/RyR complexes. Investigation into the cellular importance of this mechanism was undertaken using PC12 cells by fluoroimaging the actions of specific PCB congeners on [Ca2+]i and pH. RyR and IP3R share a common intracellular Ca2+ store in PC12 cells. Perfusion of nM to low microM PCB95 caused a transient rise of [Ca2+]i that was not completely dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Pre-incubation of the cells with ryanodine or FK506 completely eliminated PCB95 responses, suggesting a primary action on the FKPP12/RyR-sensitive store. PCB95, but not PCB126, induced a gradual decrease in  cytosolic pH that could be completely eliminated by FK506 pre-incubation of the cells. Direct respiration measurement using isolated brain mitochondria demonstrated that neither of the PCBs directly altered any stage of mitochondrial respiration. These results revealed that PCB95 disrupts intracellular Ca2+ signaling in PC12 cells by interaction with the FKBP12/RyR complex that in turn accelerated cellular metabolism, possibly affecting signaling between ER and mitochondria. Since ortho-substituted PCBs have been shown to be neurotoxic and may affect neurodevelopment, studies on the molecular mechanism by which they alter cellular signaling may provide valuable information on the physiological roles of FKPB12 and RyR on neuronal functions.
